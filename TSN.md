# TRIZ Social Network

The idea of this WUMM subproject ist to set up a **TRIZ Social Network** (TSN)
similar to our attempt to set up a [Social
Network](https://symbolicdata.github.io/CASN) for the Computer Algebra
community.

The main source are different RDF files collected within the [WUMM RDFData
subproject](https://github.com/wumm-project/RDFData).  For the moment the
`People` and the `TRIZ-Summit-2019` data is mirrored (due to performance
reasons) and links are produced to view this data. 

* [Frequently asked questions](TSN-FAQ "wikilink")

## People in the TRIZ Social Network

For each person listed in the data base a URI is created to reference this
person in subsequent files (in particular as speakers in conference reports).
We store only spare information and encourage people to add more information,
in particular links to their homepages.

A first list of [People](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/people.php) was mainly
extracted from the web pages of the TRIZ Summit 2019 in Minsk and enriched
with some additional information. See our [FAQ](TSN-FAQ "wikilink") about some
consideration on privacy.

## Conferences

A special function within the TSN could be overviews about past conferences,
i.e., to have a single source of reference, what were the talks, where to find
papers and slides etc. In the [RDFData
subproject](https://github.com/wumm-project/RDFData) there is a subfolder
`Conferences` that contains such information in RDF format compliant with
Linked Open Data rules about TRIZ conferences (for the moment only about the
**TRIZ Summit 2019** in Minsk).  As proof of concept this information is
extracted and displayed at our [Conference
Page](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/presentations.php).

## Presentations

We collect [Presentations](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/presentations.php) from
different parties that are supplied to the public under the Terms of a
Creative Commons License.  See also the Presentations directory in our [web
repo](https://github.com/wumm-project/web).
