# TRIZ Social Network

The idea of this WUMM subproject ist to set up a **TRIZ Social Network** (TSN)
similar to our attempt to set up a [Social
Network](https://symbolicdata.github.io/CASN) for the Computer Algebra
community.

The main source are different RDF files collected within the [WUMM RDFData
subproject](https://github.com/wumm-project/RDFData).  For the moment the
`People` and the `TRIZ-Summit-2019` data is mirrored (due to performance
reasons) and links are produced to view this data. 

* [Frequently asked questions](TSN-QA "wikilink")
* The WTSP Project of Toru Nakagawa
  * <https://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/eWTSP/eWTSP-WorldCatalog/eWTSP-World%20Catalog-World/World-SourceDocuments.html>

## People in the TRIZ Social Network

For each person listed in the data base a URI is created to reference this
person in subsequent files (in particular as speakers in conference reports).
We store only spare information and encourage people to add more information,
in particular links to their homepages.

A first list of [People](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/people.php) was mainly
extracted from the web pages of the TRIZ Summit 2019 in Minsk and enriched
with some additional information. See our [FAQ](TSN-FAQ "wikilink") about some
consideration on privacy.

## TRIZ Certificates

On the MATRIZ website a [list of certifies TRIZ
specialists](https://matriz.org/matriz-offices/council-on-expertise-and-methodology-cem/certification/lists-of-certified-triz-specialists/)
is published.  The list is maintained at
<https://www.nanoq.pl/matriz_database/all/> and can easily be analyzed for
statistical information.  Below you find a statistics of the 31894 certified
specialists per country as of 2021-02-11.

## International Organizations

* [MA TRIZ - the International TRIZ Organization](https://matriz.org/)
  * For the most part MA TRIZ activity deals with TRIZ specialists attestation
    and certification, organization of conferences, holding international TRIZ
    contests for schoolchildren and students, examining TRIZ methods and other
    materials, providing TRIZ specialists with informational support,
    publishing activity, keeping memory of TRIZ founder H.S. Altshuller, etc.
  * By its bylaws MA TRIZ is an "organization of organizations".
  * [More about MATRIZ](https://matriz.org/about-matriz/)
* [ETRIA - The European TRIZ Association](http://etria.eu/portal/)
  * The ETRIA Portal is the official website of the European TRIZ Association,
    where we inform public about our activities and events, and maintain a
    virtual venue for the ETRIA community to communicate and collaborate.

## Conferences

A special function within the TSN could be overviews about past conferences,
i.e., to have a single source of reference, what were the talks, where to find
papers and slides etc. In the [RDFData
subproject](https://github.com/wumm-project/RDFData) there is a subfolder
`Conferences` that contains such information in RDF format compliant with
Linked Open Data rules about TRIZ conferences (for the moment only about the
**TRIZ Summit 2019** in Minsk).  As proof of concept this information is
extracted and displayed at our [Conference
Page](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/conferences.php).

What I learned so far the main Conferences in the area are

* [TRIZ Future](http://etria.eu/portal/index.php/past-etria-conferences-mainmenu-67)
  - Annual Conference organized by ETRIA since 2001 (in English).
  - [Proceedings](http://etria.eu/portal/index.php/conference-papers-and-proceedings)
* [TRIZ Summit](http://triz-summit.ru/confer/)
  - Annual Conference since 2005 (in Russian).
* [TRIZFest](https://matriz.org)
  - Annual Conference since 2011, organized by MA TRIZ (in English).
  - [Proceedings](https://matriz.org/trizfest-proceedings/)
