* [a Russian version](Upload/lte-19-ru.pdf) (of Dec 11, 2019)

### Background

In the TRIZ Cup 2019/20, in one of the nominations the TRIZ laws of
development of technical systems are referenced.  Around this topic started a
discussion about how these laws or trends are to be understood at all. In the
discussion, the German-speaking debate on an adequate understanding of the
notion "technology" and the Russian-speaking debate on these TRIZ development
laws meet, which is why the following remarks are summarized in German with
Russian translation or vice versa. A translation into English can be tackled
if needed at a later date.
