##  What's the Relation of Man to its Technical Systems? 

Meanwhile I compiled a more detailed argumentation (May 2020)

    for the TFC 2020.

    Differently trimmed Russian version, containing another part of the
    argumentation, prepared for the TDS 2020.

Moreover there are other argumentations available, e.g.,

### Background

In the TRIZ Cup 2019/20, in one of the nominations the TRIZ laws of
development of technical systems are referenced.  Around this topic started a
discussion about how these laws or trends are to be understood at all. In the
discussion, the German-speaking debate on an adequate understanding of the
notion "technology" and the Russian-speaking debate on these TRIZ development
laws meet, which is why the following remarks are summarized in German with
Russian translation or vice versa. A translation into English can be tackled
if needed at a later date.

### What's a technical system?

This was discussed in a facebook thread [documented](2019-08-07 "wikilink") in
my blog.

### More material (in German)
