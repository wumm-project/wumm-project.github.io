# TRIZ Pedagogics Network

## Background

**TRIZ Pedagogy**, i.e. TRIZ in the secondary education of young people, is a
strongly upcoming new branch of TRIZ practices.  At the TRIZ-Fest 2019 in
Heilbronn, the annual MA TRIZ meeting, there was a whole section on that theme
and even made the decision, concentrate the further MA TRIZ efforts in three
directions, "classical TRIZ", "TRIZ and Business", and "TRIZ Pedagogy".

We started this web place to collect and inform about this (not very) new
direction of TRIZ practices and the activities going on there.

## A not at all complete survey

### The TRIZ Developers Summit Cup

The TRIZ Developers Summit Cup competition is an annually offered
international competition for children 8-18 years, students and teachers that
starts in October and whose final round is organized at the annual TRIZ
Developers Summit.
* [More about the final round 2019 in Minsk](https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-ru/talks/800)

The competition offers tasks in different nominations (Inventive activity,
fantasizing, TRIZ tools, research, TRIZ videos) for different age categories
(8-10 years, 11-14 years, 15-17 years, students).  Submissions have to be sent
electronically to the organizers.

The competition was established in 2014 and has been offered annually since
then. The materials and further notes on implementation and results are
available in Russian on the
[website of the competition](https://triz-summit.ru/contest/).

English versions of the competition are available from the website of the
organizers for the

editions.  Within the
[OpenDiscovery project](https://github.com/wumm-project/OpenDiscovery) 
we started to recompile the material of the 2019/20 contest as Open Source
LaTeX versions and provide a (not yet authorized) German translation.
