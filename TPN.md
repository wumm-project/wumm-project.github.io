# TRIZ Pedagogics Network

## Background

**TRIZ Pedagogy**, i.e. TRIZ in the secondary education of young people, is a
strongly upcoming new branch of TRIZ practices.  At the TRIZ-Fest 2019 in
Heilbronn, the annual MA TRIZ meeting, there was a whole section on that theme
and even made the decision, concentrate the further MA TRIZ efforts in three
directions, "classical TRIZ", "TRIZ and Business", and "TRIZ Pedagogy".

We started this web place to collect and inform about this (not very) new
direction of TRIZ practices and the activities going on there.

## A not at all complete survey

* TRIZ-Tournament (TRIZ-Cup) - an international competition that starts
  annually in October for children 8-18 years and whose final was organized at
  the TRIZ Summit 2019 in Minsk
  * https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-ru/talks/800
* Диагностика развития изобретательского мышления на основе методов ТРИЗ
  (Diagnostics of Inventive Thinking based on TRIZ methods) - work by Natalja
  Rubina on obtaining the title of a TRIZ Master (2013)
* Christoph Dobrusskin (Philips, Eindhoven) organized several TRIZ Remote
  Workshops (2016, 2017, 2019, another is planned for 2020). This concept,
  which currently addresses only adult development teams, is also being ramped
  up for children. Christoph is responsible for secondary level TRIZ in the
  MATRIZ Board, the International TRIZ Association.
