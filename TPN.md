# TRIZ Pedagogics Network

More on [TRIZ Online Courses](TOC "wikilink")  

## Background

**TRIZ Pedagogy**, i.e. TRIZ in the secondary education of young people, is a
strongly upcoming new branch of TRIZ practices.  At the TRIZ-Fest 2019 in
Heilbronn, the annual MATRIZ meeting, there was a whole section on that theme
and even made the decision, concentrate the further MATRIZ efforts in three
directions, "classical TRIZ", "TRIZ and Business", and "TRIZ Pedagogy".

We started this web page to collect and inform about this (not very) new
direction of TRIZ practices and the activities going on there.

## A not at all complete survey

### The TRIZ Developers Summit Cup

The TRIZ Developers Summit Cup competition is an annually offered
international competition on TRIZ challenges for children, students and
teachers. It starts every year in October, projects can be submitted in
digital form until a deadline in March. The final round is organized at the
annual TRIZ Developers Summit.  The competition offers tasks in different
_nominations_ (Inventive activity, fantasizing, TRIZ tools, research, TRIZ
videos) for different _age categories_ (8-10 years, 11-14 years, 15-17 years,
students).  

The competition was established in 2014 and has been offered annually since
then. The materials and further notes on implementation and results are
available in Russian on the website of the competition.
