# TRIZ Pedagogy Network

More on [TRIZ Online Courses](TOC)  

## Background

**TRIZ Pedagogy**, i.e. TRIZ in the secondary education of young people, is a
strongly upcoming new branch of TRIZ practices.  At the TRIZ-Fest 2019 in
Heilbronn, the annual MATRIZ meeting, there was a whole section on that theme
and even made the decision, concentrate the further MATRIZ efforts in three
directions, "classical TRIZ", "TRIZ and Business", and "TRIZ Pedagogy".

We started this web page to collect and inform about this (not very) new
direction of TRIZ practices and the activities going on there.
