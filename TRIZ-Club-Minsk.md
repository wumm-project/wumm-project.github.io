(English translations of titles and abstracts from the Minsk TRIZ Club web
site)

### 4.8.: 27 May 2021

__Mikhail Rubin:  Evolutionary systems science and the general laws of systems development. __ 

Initially, the focus of TRIZ was the study of the laws of technical system
development. However, as TRIZ penetrated into other fields of activity, IT,
business, etc., the need to study universal laws of systems development arose.
TRIZ Master Mikhail Rubin has long been engaged in research related to the
identification of such universal laws of systems development. In his report,
he will talk about his research and show the direction of TRIZ development
towards evolutionary systems science.

### 4.7.: 28 Apr 2021

__Nikolai Shpakovsky. TRIZ and the application of the methodology to problem
solving. A presentation on your questions. __

At the meeting, we plan to tell you about the specifics of solving an
inventive problem using the example of one of the objects/processes
("Patrolling planes"), as this topic received the maximum number of votes. The
meeting will be held in a dialogue format: participants will be able to
propose their own variants and solutions.

### 4.6.: 31 Mar 2021

__Andrei Kuryan. Applying TRIZ to processes__

Initially, TRIZ was applied to technical systems. As TRIZ occupied other
fields, including management and business, the task of applying TRIZ tools to
processes became relevant.

In the talk a model for finding inventive problems in business and management
processes will be presented. The talk will be of interest to business
analysts, business engineers, managers, and developers of management systems.

### 4.5.: 24 Feb 2021

__Olga Eckardt. Leadership as an exact science__

Until Pythagoras published his theorem, solving quadratic equations was an art
form. This is the case in almost all fields - moving from art to solutions and
tools. We will be looking at what tools a leader has, why he/she needs these
tools and how they work. Why a group is not a team, and how to form remote and
distributed teams. Why a TRIZ leader and a TRIZ practitioner need
leadership. What contradictions there are in a team and why create them.

### 4.4.: 27 Jan 2021

__Nataliya Rubina. How do you think. Inventive Thinking: Formation and
Diagnosis__

TRIZ is a scientific discipline that studies both the laws of technical system
development and the patterns by which inventive thinking works and
develops. We will discuss the hypothesis of forming a special type of
thinking - inventive thinking. If ARIZ is taken as a benchmark of inventive
thinking, a qualitative model of inventive thinking can be built and used to
diagnose (compare) it with the real thinking of TRIZ seminar attendees. In
addition, such a model can be used to evaluate the techniques proposed for
inventive thinking development, project team building, etc.

### 4.3: 30 Dec 2020

New Year TRIZ competition, organized by Olga Eckardt and Igor Devojno

### 4.2: 25 Nov 2020

__Sergei Kozlovsky. Fields of inquiry in the discovery industry__

Sergei Kozlovsky will discuss how TRIZ approaches can be used in scientific
research to plan and make scientific discoveries.

#### 4.1: 28 Dec 2020

__Olga Eckardt. A diversionary approach in non-technical areas. Examples of
applications__

Diversion Analysis was developed for technical systems where troubleshooting
can be very difficult and rare. Extending this approach to non-technical areas
involves modifying and adapting it to economic, social, pedagogical and other
non-technical areas.

The principle of turning a problem into an opportunity to create such a
situation using the resources of the system remains the same, but the typical
problems and tasks look different.

The presentation will give examples from the field of project management in
the creation of software products and business process support. In addition to
theory, it will be shown how to apply this principle in practice.

"skill" has many applications. One of them is to increase the constructiveness
of meetings.

## From the season 1

__Why do we need TRIZ if inventive problems have been and are being solved
without it?__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fd3ci88dS0>

Round table.  The invited guest is Valery Mikhailovich Tsurikov, founder of
the Minsk TRIZ school.

__Nikolai Shpakovsky. Transition from Problem Situation to Inventive Problem__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snu7Uj5i17A>

Real inventive problems differ from learning problems in that we very rarely
have a clear formulation of the condition. More often, it is an unclear
problem situation which needs to be analysed and one or more problems
formulated to be solved.  We will get acquainted with some approaches to the
analysis of the problem situation, and compare their advantages and
disadvantages.

__Igor Devoyno. Introduction to the laws of development of technical systems__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgo3RmpckyQ>

An overview of the laws of development of technical systems, their
applications and the logic behind their use in TRIZ methodologies.

__Petr Chuksin. FVA of the combing cutterbar__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma8pz7EyYz0>

Analysis of an FVA (function value analysis) and technical problem solving
project for _ShelbourneReynolds_ in the UK. Stage 1: Reducing the machine's
metal consumption and manufacturing costs. Stage 2: Design and manufacture of
a new generation machine based on the results of the FVA.

__Igor Devoyno. New functions in technical and information systems. Part 2__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZSfgbgr0SM>

Another mechanism of emergence of new functions, based on the law of human
displacement from a technical system, is considered. The application of this
mechanism in both hardware and software systems is shown.

__Andrey Kuryan. Types of contradictions in TRIZ__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKGyKAVlDMc>

An overview of types of contradictions in TRIZ: administrative contradiction,
technical contradiction (requirements), alternative systems contradiction,
parametric contradiction, conflicting pair, physical contradiction
(properties), macro and micro, elementary contradictions. A network of
contradictions in OTSM-TRIZ. A general scheme of working with contradictions.

__Andrey Kuryan. Corporate Training as a Service__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Vajn0MlW8>

The case describes the work of an innovation team in analysing corporate
training as an internal service.  The case study will demonstrate how
inventive problems were identified using value proposition analysis of the
service and how they were solved using TRIZ.

__Igor Devoyno. New functions in technical and information systems__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZZfHPRj0Ng>

Part 1. One of the development areas of technical systems is functionality
building. It is important that the functions introduced are required by the
users. There are several mechanisms for introducing new functions.  One of
such mechanisms will be discussed in this presentation.  The methodology is
applicable to both 'hardware' and 'software' systems.

__Nikolai Shpakovsky. General Inventive Problem Solving Scheme__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUPp7QtM7qo>

TRIZ tools are an important and effective means of solving problems. But the
rational process of solving them is just as important. The problems solved
with the help of TRIZ are quite diverse, but there are many similarities in
the approaches to solving them.  We will review the basic principles of
constructing algorithms for inventive problem solving and compare their
advantages and disadvantages.

__Nikolai Shpakovsky. Applying TRIZ to forecasting__

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EScSGHwGadU>

Case study and discussion.
