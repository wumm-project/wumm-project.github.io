### 4.4.: 27 Jan 2021

__Nataliya Rubina. How do you think. Inventive Thinking: Formation and
Diagnosis__

TRIZ is a scientific discipline that studies both the laws of technical system
development and the patterns by which inventive thinking works and
develops. We will discuss the hypothesis of forming a special type of thinking
- inventive thinking. If ARIZ is taken as a benchmark of inventive thinking, a
qualitative model of inventive thinking can be built and used to diagnose
(compare) it with the real thinking of TRIZ seminar attendees. In addition,
such a model can be used to evaluate the techniques proposed for inventive
thinking development, project team building, etc.

#### 4.1: 28 Dec 2020

Olga Eckardt. A diversionary approach in non-technical areas. Examples of
applications

Diversion Analysis was developed for technical systems where troubleshooting
can be very difficult and rare. Extending this approach to non-technical areas
involves modifying and adapting it to economic, social, pedagogical and other
non-technical areas.

The principle of turning a problem into an opportunity to create such a
situation using the resources of the system remains the same, but the typical
problems and tasks look different.

The presentation will give examples from the field of project management in
the creation of software products and business process support. In addition to
theory, it will be shown how to apply this principle in practice.
