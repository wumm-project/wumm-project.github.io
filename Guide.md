# A Small Guide through the WUMM Infrastructure

Note that the project was originated by a TRIZ freshman that tries to learn
more about the concepts, available resources and communicational
infrastructure of the TRIZ community.  Since this freshman has a strong
background in modern semantic technologies that special format is used to
report about findings and experience and we hope that this is useful also for
third parties.  Of course, you are invited to join the team ...

In part I found out so far that a significant portion of the debates are
conducted in Russian in the Russian-speaking TRIZ community. We started to
compile a little guide to that debates within our [TRIZ Social Network](TSN
"wikilink") subproject and also a more personal viev in [HGG's Blog](HGG-Blog
"wikilink").
