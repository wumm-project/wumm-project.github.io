# The TRIZ Ontology Project (TOP)

## The [TDS Summit Ontology Project](TOP)

### Motivation (English translation)

Source: <https://triz-summit.ru/onto_triz/>

The theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is an area of knowledge about
the laws and trends in the development of technical systems, methods and tools
for forecasting, identifying, analysing and solving contradictions in the
development of systems. TRIZ is based on the laws of dialectics, using
evolutionary, systematic, functional, model and other fundamental scientific
approaches. The TRIZ model includes connections between models of inventive
tasks and models of their solution, as well as models of systems with models
of their development. TRIZ reveals the regularities and methods of formation
and development of inventive thinking, methods of development of creative
imagination. TRIZ methods and tools are applicable for solving inventive tasks
not only in techniques, but also for non-technical systems. TRIZ is used in
practice for development of creative personality, solution of inventive tasks
in various fields, in innovative entrepreneurship, in solution of tasks in
enterprises.

## The [WUMM TRIZ Ontology Project](WOP-General)

Within the WUMM TRIZ Ontology Project links to TRIZ ontology and glossary
projects are collected. One of the goals of the project is to transform that
information into RDF as __the__ machine readable standard of the Web 3.0 (also
called "Semantic Web").  This is done already for several materials, as e.g.,
the TRIZ Inventive Standards, the 40 Principles, the TRIZ Body of Knowledge.
The main work is ahead &ndash; to agree upon a consolidated version of all
that material.

See [our more detailed description](WOP-General) of the RDF sources for an
introduction to the RDF vocabulary developed so far.  Note that this
information is not necessarily up to date since we use an agile approach to
develop the RDF material.

We provide a [prototypical presentation](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/index.php)
of most of the RDF material collected so far as proof of concept.
