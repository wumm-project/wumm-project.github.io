# Different activities concerning TRIZ ontology and glossary projects

Here some links to TRIZ ontology and glossary projects are collected. One of
the goals of the WUMM project is to transform that information into RDF as
__the__ machine readable standard of the Web 3.0 (also called "Semantic Web").
There are other materials, as e.g.,
* the TRIZ Inventive Standards
* the 40 Principles
* the TRIZ Body of Knowledge

that must be included into a fully fledged Ontology Project and that are
already (prototypically) transformed to the RDF format within the WUMM
project, see the [WUMM Demonstration
Site](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/index.php) for a first approximation.  The
main work is ahead &ndash; to agree upon a consolidated version of all that
material.

See [our more detailed description](OntologyDetails "wikilink") of the RDF
sources for an introduction to the RDF vocabulary developed so far.  Note that
this information is not necessarily up to date since we use an agile approach
to develop the RDF material.

We provide a [prototypical presentation](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/index.php)
of most of the RDF material collected so far as proof of the concept.
