# Justus Schollmeyer

## Short CV

Justus Schollmeyer studied philosophy at the Freie Universität Berlin and at
the Sorbonne Paris IV. He is working on the logic of engineering methods for
resolving system contradictions (TRIZ) and on its interdisciplinary
application. The results directly affect his PhD project on sustainable
organisation development supervised by Prof. Georg Müller-Christ at the
University of Bremen. The aim of this dissertation is the development of
effective methods for uncovering and resolving system contradictions with
regard to issues of sustainability. In this way, Georg Müller-Christ's
approach for coping with dilemmas of resource-oriented management is to be
supplemented by adequate problem solving tools (for a German version see
below).
