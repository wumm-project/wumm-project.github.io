# TRIZ and Complex Systems

The central notion of TRIZ is that of a __technical system__ and a Theory of
Evolution of Technical and General Systems ([TTS](TTS)) provides a frame for
reasonable justifications concerning the appropriate use of TRIZ tools. The
TRIZ __laws__ of evolution of technical systems are more than mere __trends__
(as claimed in the recent MATRIZ standard book on the topic) - at least if
trend is coined as in fashion or wheather trend - but (at least) _best
practices_ extracted from huge engineering experience that could be
disregarded, but this would not be an intelligible action.

One of the discussion point is the question of the scope of application of
these laws, since most of them are extracted from life lines as in (Altshuller
1979) and thus from practices of _reusable_ technical systems that appear in a
greater variety of similar realisations.  This does not cover __large
technical systems__ (plants, software frameworks etc.) since those are unique
specimen not designed for reuse even if standard components are used to
compile them.

This raises the problem of a sound definition of the notion of a __system__
and the foundation of a __systems science__.  

## About the Notion of a System

Alexander Bogdanov: A __system__ is a set of elements or relations that are
naturally connected with each other into a single whole, which has a property
that is absent in individual elements or in their unorganized aggregates
(integrative property).

(Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory>)

A __system__ is a cohesive group of interrelated and interdependent parts
which can be natural or human-made. Every system is
* bounded by space and time,
* influenced by its environment,
* defined by its structure and purpose, and
* expressed through its functioning.
A system may be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or
emergent behavior.

Changing one part of a system may affect other parts or the whole system. It
may be possible to predict these changes in patterns of behavior. For systems
that learn and adapt, the growth and the degree of adaptation depend upon how
well the system is engaged with its environment. Some systems support other
systems, maintaining the other system to prevent failure. The goals of systems
theory are to model a system's dynamics, constraints, conditions, and to
elucidate principles (such as purpose, measure, methods, tools) that can be
discerned and applied to other systems at every level of nesting, and in a
wide range of fields for achieving optimized equifinality.

(Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_L._Ackoff>)

Any human-created systems can be characterized as "purposeful system" when its
"members are also purposeful individuals who intentionally and collectively
formulate objectives and are parts of larger purposeful systems". Other
characteristics are:
* A purposeful system or individual is ideal-seeking if... it chooses another
  objective that more closely approximates its ideal.
* An ideal-seeking system or individual is necessarily one that is purposeful,
  but not all purposeful entities seek ideals, and
* The capability of seeking ideals may well be a characteristic that
  distinguishes man from anything he can make, including computers.
