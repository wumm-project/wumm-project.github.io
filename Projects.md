# A list of Project Ideas and Applications

* [Application](SIM "wikilink") for an EU "Knowledge Alliance".
  * The application submitted in February 2020 was not successful.  The
    material of the application and the reviewers' report are available. For a
    second try the partner structure should be improved along the lines drawn
    in the reviewers' report.
* A possible [TRIZ Consortium Structure](TTN "wikilink") 
  * The current TRIZ Consortium Structure reflects the state of affairs during
    the process of compiling the EU KA proposal that was finished in February
    2020. We set up a special [TTN mailing
    list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn) as
    means for communication.  The idea was to use that cooperative structure
    also for preparation of other proposals.
