# A list of Project Ideas and Applications

* [Application](SIM "wikilink") for an EU "Knowledge Alliance".
  * The application submitted in February 2020 was not successful.  The
    material of the application and the reviewers' report are available. For a
    second try the partner structure should be improved along the lines drawn
    in the reviewers' report.
* A possible [TRIZ Consortium Structure](TTN "wikilink") 
  * The current TRIZ Consortium Structure reflects the state of affairs during
    the process of compiling the EU KA proposal that was finished in    
    February 2020. The idea was to use that cooperative structure also for
    preparation of other proposals.
* Some [first ideas](ReNSI "wikilink") about a strong academic project for a
  Horizon2020 application.

We set up a special [TTN mailing
list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn) as means
for communication that you are encouraged to subscribe and add your own
contributions.  With this infrastructure we follow a "flow and stock"
approach, having the mailing list (and other social media "flows") as the
_exchange structure_ and this Wiki (realized as github pages hence best suited
to set up a _group_ of editors) as keeping up and sorted the _stock of ideas_.
