# Philosophical Foundations of TRIZ

TRIZ has several philosophical roots.

Thinking in contradictions, in categories of processes and development and
dialectics point to the heritage of western philosophy in the tradition of
Kant, Hegel and Marx.

Due to the roots of the majority of _TRIZoviks_ in the former Soviet union one
has to take into account the special circumstances of life and thinking.

The first one was addressed by [Slava
Gerovich](http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/) as the impossibility publicly to
discuss social contradictions thus strongly restricting the notion of
creativity and inventiveness to problems rooted in technology.

  in the USSR: Changes in the Discourse. Technology and Culture, Vol. 37.1,
  S. 102--134.
  <http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/articles/Gerovitch-Perestroika.pdf>

The second one is nevertheless a philosophical heritage developing after
Stalin's death particularly in Moscow around the __Moscow Methodological
Circle__ that is claimed by several sources a quite influential not only for
peple working in TRIZ but also [in a wider
range](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/65015) of the postsoviet Russian
establishment.

## The Moscow Methodological Circle (MMK). A Bird's Eye.

> The ideas of the Russian philosopher Georgy Shchedrovitsky, who founded the
> “Moscow Methodological Circle” gained traction in the late 1950s and had
> resonance through Khrushchev’s thaw, Brezhnev’s stagnation, and Gorbachev’s
> perestroika—right up until his death in 1994.

> Shchedrovitsky essentially viewed human beings as machines that must be
> programed to perform certain functions—essentially, the theory of “social
> engineering.” The literary scholar Ilya Kukulin has found some similarities
> between Shchedrovitsky’s philosophy and the works of Soviet-era science
> fiction writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky: most of their novels feature a
> “progressor,” a man who finds himself in the past or on a backward planet
> and eventually changes the world around him.

> In effect, Shchedrovitsky and his followers were themselves progressors.
> They made no secret of their intent to influence government decisions, and
> it’s quite possible that Shchedrovitsky’s followers played a role in
> perestroika in the 1980s, since thousands of people had been exposed to his
> philosophy by this time.

The idea "A man who finds himself in the past or on a backward planet and
eventually changes the world around him" is one of the core ideas of the TRIZ
subtheory TRTL (theory of the development of a creative personality) that
builds up a quite special mixture of anarcho-communistic, libertarian and
neoliberal ideas, but has also links to the notion of _Concrete Utopia_ by
Ernst Bloch.

  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Shchedrovitsky>
  * He became involved in the Moscow Methodological Circle set up by Alexander
    Zinoviev. In 1954, Shchedrovitsky took over leadership of the circle and
    played a prominent role in developing activity theory. Here the world was
    not seen as composed of human subjects and objects as in naturalistic
    theory.  Rather objects are secondary constructs whose nature depends on
    the activity applied to them.

      naturalistic world, whereby the world of thinking is primary and the
      naturalistic world is nothing but a construction of the naturalists."
