Dear colleagues!

The creation of a TRIZ Ontology is a new stage in the formation of TRIZ as a
science. A TRIZ Ontology allows systematizing already existing knowledge in
the field of TRIZ and outlining ways of further development. The first steps
on formation of TRIZ Ontology have now been taken. About ten TRIZ specialists
from Belarus, Russia, Germany, Lithuania, Israel, Netherlands, France take
part in the project. We would like to expand the circle of participants of
this project, discuss with you the results obtained and invite the most
interested specialists to joint further work in this ambitious project.

In the coming months we plan to hold short weekly webinars on various aspects
of the TRIZ Ontology project. We will discuss two topics:
- general information about the TRIZ Ontology project, what it is for and what
  it gives (Andrey Kuryan)
- approaches to forming ontological maps, TRIZ Model ontology (Mikhail Rubin).

The duration of the presentation is 45-60 minutes, 30-45 minutes - discussion.
In the following weekly webinars on TRIZ Ontology, we will cover the following
topics:
- Function model and functional analysis,
- Flow model and flow analysis,
- System operator and system operator analysis,
- TRIZ tools,
- TRIZ scientific bases
and other topics.

A brief information on the current status of the project was presented at the
conference in the report by A. Kuryan, M. Rubin, N. Shchedrin, O. Eckardt,
N. Rubina "TRIZ Ontology. Current status and prospects". 
 
At present we plan to discuss the first results of the project with specially
invited TRIZ specialists. For this purpose, we invite you to take part in a
