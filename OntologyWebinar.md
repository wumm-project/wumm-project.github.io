Dear colleagues!

The creation of a TRIZ Ontology is a new stage in the formation of TRIZ as a
science. A TRIZ Ontology allows systematizing already existing knowledge in
the field of TRIZ and outlining ways of further development. The first steps
on formation of TRIZ Ontology have now been taken. About ten TRIZ specialists
from Belarus, Russia, Germany, Lithuania, Israel, Netherlands, France take
part in the project. We would like to expand the circle of participants of
this project, discuss with you the results obtained and invite the most
interested specialists to joint further work in this ambitious project.

In the coming months we plan to hold short weekly webinars on various aspects
of the TRIZ Ontology project. We will discuss two topics:
- general information about the TRIZ Ontology project, what it is for and what
  it gives (Andrey Kuryan)
- approaches to forming ontological maps, TRIZ Model ontology (Mikhail Rubin).

The duration of the presentation is 45-60 minutes, 30-45 minutes - discussion.
In the following weekly webinars on TRIZ Ontology, we will cover the following
topics:
- Function model and functional analysis,
- Flow model and flow analysis,
- System operator and system operator analysis,
- TRIZ tools,
- TRIZ scientific bases
and other topics.

A brief information on the current status of the project was presented at the
conference in the report by A. Kuryan, M. Rubin, N. Shchedrin, O. Eckardt,
N. Rubina "TRIZ Ontology. Current status and prospects". 
 
At present we plan to discuss the first results of the project with specially
invited TRIZ specialists. For this purpose, we invite you to take part in a
series of webinars. At these webinars different parts of the TRIZ Ontology
will be presented and detailed information on how to become a participant of
this project will be provided.

The webinars will take place at tuesdays 19:00 Moscow time based on ZOOM. The
working language is Russian. Preliminary plan for the webinars:

## How to become a participant of the project

Вы сообщили, что Ваша папка на портале OSA пустая, без онтологий. Так и должно
быть. Согласно замыслу разработчиков у Вас должен быть доступ только к тем
проектам на портале (онто-картам), которые создавали Вы. Если Вы хотите изучит
карты других пользователей, то необходимо запросить ссылку к онто-карте. Обмен
ссылками возможен через групповой чат команды разработчиков онтологии ТРИЗ.

You informed us that your folder on the OSA portal is empty, without
ontologies. This is the way it should be. The intention of the developers is
that you should only have access to those projects on the portal (onto-cards)
that you created. If you want to study other users' cards, you must request a
link to the onto-card. Exchange links are available through the group chat of
the TRIZ ontology development team.

Added by HGG: See also the role of a "visitor" in the TDS 2020 paper:

> This is any person who is interested in the area of TRIZ knowledge in
> general and the TRIZ Ontology in particular. A visitor can study ontological

> discussions and express his opinions and ratings.

Hence a direct access to the ontology editor is not envisaged for that role. 

Moreover Nikolay informed about a web site
<https://triz-summit.ru/onto_triz/proj/instr/> with video instructions (in
Russian) how to register with OSA and start working on the project.
