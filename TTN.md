# TRIZ Trainings Network

At the [TRIZ Summit in June 2019 in Minsk](https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-eng/)
we discussed in more detail plans to set up an *European TRIZ
Trainings Network* (TTN) and compile an EU proposal to support these plans.

EU proposals are open to *Programme Countries* and *Associated Countries*.
Interest to join forces within this proposal signaled partners from Programme
Countries, Belarus, Morocco and Russia.  There are strong developments to
include also Belarus into the list of Associated Countries, although the
current state is not clear.  Russia belongs to the "countries with jointly
agreed co-funding mechanism covering most or all thematic areas".

Meanwhile TRIZ groups in the Program Countries, Belarus and Russia expressed
their interest to join forces **on our project** to compile an EU proposal in
the proposed direction.  This Web page contains the current state of
preparation of this project as agreed within the communication on our
[mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn)
(with archive accessible to members).  If you are interested to join the
project, please send a mail to
[Hans-Gert Gräbe](http://bis.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/HansGertGraebe/) as the
main coordinator of the project proposal.

In parallel we are discussing to apply for a EC research project to set up a
[Research Network on Systematic Innovation (ReNSI)](ReNSI "wikilink") and (on
the longer run) also to an [European Idustrial Doctorate](EID "wikilink").

## Main ideas

TRIZ trainings exist or are to be developed in many places within the region
under consideration.

The **main focus** of a TTN should therefore be the coordination and mutual
support for these activities and the wider dissemination of *Contradition
Oriented Systematic Innovation* (COSI) as an efficient methodology for solving
complex problems that refuse simple, linear solutions, i.e. the 20%
"Pareto-heavy" tasks, in particular in the *newly emerging technology areas*.
* „TRIZ works well, but one of the key issues is that TRIZ is not yet well
  known; it seems to be too complex but all the attempts to simplify TRIZ did
  quite a damage to its reputation. TRIZ must not be simplified; instead, it
  must be properly structured, learned, and implemented. Only then the real
  results will come, and they will do it at a large scale. But we must admit
  that TRIZ has reached a turning point: it must be capable of supporting
  innovation in all the new and emerging technologies and methodologies of the
  21st century: AI, big data, design thinking, sustainability, IoT, new
  approaches to education, and so forth“. (Valeri Souchkov in his
  [Report on the TRIZFest 2019](https://matriz.org/trizfest-2019-report))

The **big story** could be based on the challenges that arise for Europe from
the developments in the Asian region especially in this area (the
mass-engineer-oriented training model MEOTM program in China, MATRIZ has
massive membership growth from this region, so even majorities are changing),
but so far are only halfheartedly encountered by the European research
strategies.
* For MEOTM see Runhua Tan. TRIZ，the development and dissemination in
  industries in China.  TRIZCON 2017.
  [pdf](https://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/epapers/e2017Papers/eTan-China-Dissemination/eTan-TRIZCON2017-Paper-171012.pdf)

The **main directions of the project at large** should cover the structures
* of intra-company training,
* of training and consulting in more complex inter-company business
  structures, 
* the academic anchoring of this topic in the core engineering education,
* and the academic anchoring of appropriate training structures of further
  education,
  
even if not all these directions can be covered in a single EU proposal. 

To a lesser extent, there is a need for common curricular efforts, since many
things already exist. In the proposal we should above all focus on the
visibility and networking of such offers, in particular
* address the meta-level of the description and common digital exposition of
  existing offers
* the practical exchange of students and graduates,
* the common development of a digital infrastructure that provides an
  interface for cooperative promotion and maintenance of local
  **training services**.

A strong link should be made to OER (**Open Educational Resources**), i.e.
compile a stock of freely available (or cooperatively maintained) common
material that can serve local business (both in education and training). So
earn money not from IP but from Services.
* See the [Fellowship Repository](https://www.edisons21.com) "Educating the
  Edisons of the 21st Century" of Igor Belski et al. at the Global RMIT
  University
* Note that we started with this [WUMM Project](About.html) another initiative
  in that direction and set up a certain github based infrastructure.

## Building the Consortium

Regardless of the specific application conditions, which, depending on the
call for tenders, require a concentration on 3..5 key partners in a specific
composition, which then also lead the respective EU proposal, we are
consolidating the already visible network structures and create a pool of
**key partners** and **regional coordinators** as the core of a coordinating
structure in order to react quickly on new tenders.

The **coordinators** should
1. represent the entire regional diversity,
2. take over cooperation with other key partners in their respective region
   and  
3. take responsibility for individual work packages coordination.

The **key partners** support the coordinators in their work. The coordinators
form the project consortium that meets the key decisions based on a previously
public discussion on the project mailing list.

At the present time (20 Nov 2019) I agreed in negotiations with different
persons on the following consortial structure (ML - this person subscribed to
the project mailing list). The regions are listed in the order of the date of
the agreement.

## Funding Opportunities

In the meantime we shortly discussed to apply for an
[European Industrial Doctorate](EID "wikilink") within the Marie Curie Action,
but this turned out to be far too ambitious, serious prospects of success are
hardly to be expected in that direction in view of the academic reputation of
TRIZ approaches. 

We have therefore agreed to return to the original approach and explore the
possibilities in the context of the Capacity Building Action.  The ERASMUS+
Key Action 2 Program "Capacity Building in the field of higher education"
concentrates on different consolidating aspects of higher education, hence is
rather directed towards academic teaching.  The current call is open since 05
Nov 2019.

### From the call

to be added

### Organisational Aspects

The call is open since 05 Nov 2019, the deadline is 05 Febr 2020, so it is
very sportive to compile an application in the remaining time.

* All relevant problems are best to be discussed on our
  [mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn).
* There will be an onsite meeting at INSA Strasbourg (Denis Cavallucci) on 14
  December 2019.
