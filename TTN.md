# TRIZ Trainings Network

At the [TRIZ Summit in June 2019 in Minsk](https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-eng/)
we discussed in more detail plans to set up an *European TRIZ
Trainings Network* (TTN) and compile an EU proposal to support these plans. 

At this Web page
* the main idea is explained what the tasks of such a network could be in
  whole, and which main directions of the project at large are of interest, 
* partners are collected who, in one way or another, expressed their interest
  in participating in such a project at large, and
* a first draft for an application within the ERASMUS+ "Knowledge Alliance" is
  sketched, which is to be further detailed.

For communication purposes a
[mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn)
(with archive accessible to members) is set up to coordinate the further
application procedure. If you are interested to join the project, please send
a mail to
[Hans-Gert Gräbe](http://bis.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/HansGertGraebe/) as the
main coordinator of the project proposal.

In parallel we are discussing to apply for an EC research project to set up a
[Research Network on Systematic Innovation (ReNSI)](ReNSI "wikilink") and (on
the longer run) also to an [Trainings Network](EID "wikilink") within the much
more ambitious MSCA-ITN "Innovative Training Networks".

## Main ideas

TRIZ trainings exist or are to be developed in many places within the region
under consideration.

The **main focus** of a TTN should therefore be the coordination and mutual
support for these activities and the wider dissemination of *Contradition
Oriented Systematic Innovation* (COSI) as an efficient methodology for solving
complex problems that refuse simple, linear solutions, i.e. the 20%
"Pareto-heavy" tasks, in particular in the *newly emerging technology areas*.
* „TRIZ works well, but one of the key issues is that TRIZ is not yet well
  known; it seems to be too complex but all the attempts to simplify TRIZ did
  quite a damage to its reputation. TRIZ must not be simplified; instead, it
  must be properly structured, learned, and implemented. Only then the real
  results will come, and they will do it at a large scale. But we must admit
  that TRIZ has reached a turning point: it must be capable of supporting
  innovation in all the new and emerging technologies and methodologies of the
  21st century: AI, big data, design thinking, sustainability, IoT, new
  approaches to education, and so forth“. (Valeri Souchkov in his
  [Report on the TRIZFest 2019](https://matriz.org/trizfest-2019-report))

The **big story** could be based on the challenges that arise for Europe from
the developments in the Asian region especially in this area (the
mass-engineer-oriented training model MEOTM program in China, MATRIZ has
massive membership growth from this region, so even majorities are changing),
but so far are only halfheartedly encountered by the European research
strategies.
* For MEOTM see Runhua Tan. TRIZ，the development and dissemination in
  industries in China.  TRIZCON 2017.
  [pdf](https://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/epapers/e2017Papers/eTan-China-Dissemination/eTan-TRIZCON2017-Paper-171012.pdf)

The **main directions of the project at large** should cover the structures
* of intra-company training,
* of training and consulting in more complex inter-company business
  structures, 
* the academic anchoring of this topic in the core engineering education,
* and the academic anchoring of appropriate training structures of further
  education,
  
even if not all these directions can be covered in a single EU proposal. 

To a lesser extent, there is a need for common curricular efforts, since many
things already exist. In the proposal we should above all focus on the
visibility and networking of such offers, in particular
* address the meta-level of the description and common digital exposition of
  existing offers
* the practical exchange of students and graduates,
* the common development of a digital infrastructure that provides an
  interface for cooperative promotion and maintenance of local
  **training services**.

A strong link should be made to OER (**Open Educational Resources**), i.e.
compile a stock of freely available (or cooperatively maintained) common
material that can serve local business (both in education and training). So
earn money not from IP but from Services.
* See the [Fellowship Repository](https://www.edisons21.com) "Educating the
  Edisons of the 21st Century" of Igor Belski et al. at the Global RMIT
  University
* Note that we started with this [WUMM Project](About.html) another initiative
  in that direction and set up a certain github based infrastructure.

## Building the Consortium

Regardless of the specific application conditions, which, depending on the
call for tenders, require a concentration on a smaller number of key partners
in a specific constellation, which then also lead the respective EU proposal,
we are consolidating the already visible network structures and create a pool
of **key partners** and **regional coordinators** as the core of a
coordinating structure in order to react quickly on new tenders.

The **coordinators** should
1. represent the entire regional diversity,
2. take over cooperation with other key partners in their respective region
   and  
3. take responsibility for individual work packages coordination.

The **key partners** support the coordinators in their work. The coordinators
form the project consortium that meets the key decisions based on a previously
public discussion on the project mailing list.

At the present time (20 Nov 2019) I agreed in negotiations with different
persons on the following consortial structure (ML - this person subscribed to
the project mailing list). The regions are listed in the order of the date of
the agreement.

## Funding Opportunities

We shortly discussed to apply within the Marie Curie Action, but this turned
out to be far too ambitious, serious prospects of success are hardly to be
expected in that direction in view of the academic reputation of TRIZ
approaches.  This can be successful only on the long run.

Evaluating other opportunities the ERASMUS+ Key Action 2 Program "Knowledge
Alliances" seems best to fit the current state to link existing and planned
programs at different HEI (higher educational institutions) with the
requirements and needs of industry. 

The focus of the action is on cooperation between Programme Countries (the
strongest expressed interest in an application came so far from the EU
countries Germany, France and Finland) but organisations from Partner
Countries can also be involved, if the added value is appropriately expressed.
* As a general rule, Knowledge Alliances target the cooperation between
  organisations established in Programme Countries. However, organisations
  from Partner Countries can be involved in a Knowledge Alliance, as partners
  (not as applicants), if their participation brings an essential added value
  to the project. 

TRIZ trainings address "cross cutting" methodological skills that are useful
for engineers, computer scientists and other professions, hence fit
"developing entrepreneurship mind-set and skills" and should be included as
"general studies" in the course of studies in different special directions.
The content of such programs should be developed and coordinated in close
coordination with the needs of industry application partners. 
* Knowledge Alliances implement a coherent and comprehensive set of
  interconnected activities which are flexible and adaptable to different
  current and future contexts and developments across Europe.
* Knowledge Alliances are transnational and involve minimum six independent
  organisations from at least three Programme Countries, out of which at least
  two higher education institutions and at least two enterprises.

## From the call

* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 2-year Knowledge Alliance: 700 000 EUR
* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 3-year Knowledge Alliance: 1 000 000 EUR
* Financial contributions from the EU are calculated using fixed scale of unit
  costs.  Please see Programme Guide, page 130-133 for further information.
* These unit costs have been calculated in a way that the co-funding is
  inherent to them, i.e. already incorporated.

### Aims and Priorities

Knowledge Alliances aim at strengthening Europe's innovation capacity and at
fostering innovation in higher education, business and the broader
socio-economic environment. They intend to achieve one or more of the
following aims:
* develop new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and
  learning; 
* stimulate entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills of higher education
  teaching staff and company staff; 
* facilitate the exchange, flow and co-creation of knowledge.

The main attention is turned to projects that contribute to the modernisation
of Europe's higher education systems as outlined in the 2017 EU Communication
on the Renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education, namely:
* tackling future skills mismatches and promoting excellence in skills
  development; 
* building inclusive and connected higher education systems;
* ensuring higher education institutions contribute to innovation;
* supporting effective and efficient higher education systems.

Additional emphasis is placed on making use of existing initiatives, and on
the intelligent use of digital tools as recommended in the 2013 EU
Communication on Opening Up Education.

The Programme Guide contains a list of key features
* __Innovation__ in higher education and innovation through higher education
  in enterprises; 
* __Sustainability__ of university-business cooperation. A strong and
  committed partnership with a balanced participation from enterprises and
  higher education institutions;
* __Impact__ going beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations
  involved in the Alliance; 

which must convincingly present in a successful application. 

The Guide emphasizes that "Knowledge Alliances are a highly competitive part of
Erasmus+". Common attributes of successful proposals are:
* reliable relations between higher education institutions and enterprises:
  Knowledge Alliances have to demonstrate the commitment and added value of
  all partners, whereby strong and balanced involvement from both the business
  and higher education sectors is essential. A well designed proposal is the
  result of close cooperation between the prospective partners and based on a
  solid needs analysis;
* their innovative and transnational character, visible across all criteria.

A proper needs-analysis clarifies the rationale, influences the selection of
partners, makes the proposal specific, helps to raise the potential for impact
and ensures that end-user and target groups are well involved in the project
activities.

### Award Criteria

* Relevance of the proposal (Purpose, Consistency, Innovation, European added
  value) - 25 points
* Quality of the project design and implementation (Coherence, Structure,
  Management, Quality) - 25 points
* Quality of the project team and the cooperation arrangements (Configuration,
  Commitment, Partnership, Collaboration/team spirit, Reward, Involvement of
  Partner Countries) - 30 points
* Impact and dissemination (Exploitation, Dissemination, Impact, Open Access,
  Sustainability) - 20 points

### Important cross-sectional tasks

* __Quality assurance__ must be an embedded project component to ensure that
  Knowledge Alliances successfully deliver the expected results and achieve an
  impact going far beyond the partner organisations themselves.
* Knowledge Alliances are required to accomplish
  __targeted dissemination activities__ which reach out to stakeholders, policy
  makers, professionals and enterprises.
* Along the way Knowledge Alliances should __deliver publications__ such as
  reports, handbooks, guidelines, etc. As a general rule, results should be
  made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant
  professional, sectorial or competent authorities' platforms.
* Knowledge Alliances should generate new ways and instruments to facilitate
  their collaboration and to ensure that the partnership between higher
  education and business __persists__.
* Knowledge Alliances are a recent and ambitious Action; they are subject to a
  particular __monitoring__ which requires active participation from all
  participants and stakeholders.
* Knowledge Alliances should foresee their
  __participation in thematic clusters__
  to support cross-fertilisation, exchange of good practices and mutual
  learning.
* Additionally, Knowledge Alliances should budget for the presentation of
  their project and the results at the __University-Business Forum__ and/or
  other relevant events (up to five during the project duration).

### Ideas on Substantive Sharpening of the Application Content

In the Programme Guide a special example "Developing entrepreneurial mind-set
and skills" is described with the following content:
* creating schemes of transversal skills learning and application throughout
  higher education programmes developed in cooperation with enterprises aiming
  at strengthening employability, creativity and new professional paths;
* introducing entrepreneurship education in any discipline to provide
  students, researchers, staff and educators with the knowledge, skills and
  motivation to engage in entrepreneurial activities in a variety of settings;
* opening up new learning opportunities through the practical application of
  entrepreneurial skills, which can involve and/or lead to the
  commercialisation of new services, products and prototypes, to the creation
  of start-ups and spin-offs.

This could serve as guideline to compile our application as a curricular
development and coordination activity in a wide sense taking the aims and
priorities as guardrails and the cross-sectional tasks as beacons. 

### Organisational Aspects

The call is open since 14 Nov 2019, the deadline is 26 Febr 2020, so it is
very sportive to compile an application in the remaining time.

We have to identify 

* The __Applicant/coordinator__: a participating organisation that submits the
  project proposal on behalf of all the partners. The coordinator has the full
  responsibility to ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with
  the agreement.
  * I discussed earlier with our local authorities that the Leipzig University
    can serve as coordinator.
* __Full partners__ are those participating organisations which contribute
  actively to the achievement of the Knowledge Alliance's objectives. Each
  full partner must sign a mandate to confer to the coordinating organisation
  the responsibility of acting as main beneficiary and act in his name during
  the implementation of the project. If relevant, the same applies for
  partners from Partner Countries.
* __Associated partners__ (optional): Knowledge Alliances can involve
  associated partners who contribute to the implementation of specific project
  tasks/activities or support the dissemination and sustainability of the
  Alliance. For contractual management issues, “associated partners” are not
  considered as part of the project partners, and they do not receive funding.
  However their involvement and role in the project and different activities
  have to be clearly described.
* __Affiliated entities__ (optional): Organisations which contribute to the
  achievement of project objectives and activities.  Affiliated entities must
  be identified in the grant application and satisfy the requirements as
  described in Annex III (Glossary of terms) of this Programme Guide.

All relevant problems are best to be discussed on our
[mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn).

There will be an onsite meeting at INSA Strasbourg (Denis Cavallucci) on 16
December 2019.
