# TRIZ Trainings Network

At the [TRIZ Summit 2019](https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-eng/)
in Minsk we discussed in more detail plans to set up an *European TRIZ
Trainings Network* and compile an ERASMUS+ proposal to support these plans.
In a discussion within the core group we decided to have web sites and
communication within the core team in English.  

**This is a raw first draft of a proposal, subject to further changes in any
  place and point.**

This Web page contains the current state of preparation of the project as
agreed within the communication on our [mailing
list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn) (with
archive accessible to members).

If you are interested to join the project, please send a mail to [Hans-Gert
Gräbe](http://bis.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/HansGertGraebe/) as the main
coordinator of the project proposal.

In parallel we are discussing to apply for a EC research project to set up a
[Research Network on Systematic Innovation (ReNSI)](ReNSI "wikilink").

## The Overall Structure

### Who initiates the proposal

This is a joint initiative of the universities in Leipzig (Germany) and Minsk
(Belarus) that operate a bilateral ERASMUS cooperation agreement since 2006.

We discussed with the local administrations in Minsk (A. Rytov) and Leipzig
(A. Vorpagel) that the best chances for such a proposal are within the Key
Action 2 (1) Programme "Capacity Building in the field of higher education".
The new call is issued in October 2019. It is the last call within that
program, since the programs will change due to the upcoming new legislation
period of the EU parliament.

There was a similar call for 2018 (2) that we use as a raw guide to set up the
required consortium and agree upon the principal goals of the proposal.

### About the required structure of the proposal 

Due to the special structure of the potential partners we plan to set up a
multiregional project (3, see 3.5 and 3.6 - this has to be evaluated in more
detail). "Eligible countries" (4) are divided into *Programme Countries*
(i.e. Member States of the European Union and some Accociates) and *Partner
Countries* (neighbouring the EU)
* Region 1 - Western Balkans
* Region 2 - Eastern Partnership Countries
* Region 3 - South-Mediterranean countries
* Region 4 - Russian Federation

We plan to include partners from the Member States and the Regions 2 and 4.
The project will be coordinated by the Leipzig University (Dept. of
Mathematics and Computer Science) and co-coordinated by the Belarussian State
University Minsk.

### Building the Consortium

Due to the ERASMUS restrictions the proposal and in order to make the
coordination effort manageable we should indentify at most 10 main partners in
all involved regions, so I defined the notions *coordinator* and *key
partners* for resp. within the different regions.

The **coordinators** should
1. represent the entire regional diversity,
2. take over cooperation with other key partners in their respective region and
3. take responsibility for individual work packages coordination.

The **key partners** support the coordinators in their work. The coordinators
form the project consortium that meets the key decisions based on a previously
public discussion on the project mailing list.

At the present time (03. Oct 2019) I agreed in negotiations with different
persons on the following consortial structure (ML - this person subscribed to
the project mailing list). The regions are listed in the order of the date of

## Rough Structure of the Proposal

As explained in the 2019 guidelines (5, p. 164) “Joint Projects aim at
producing outcomes that benefit principally and directly the organisations
from eligible Partner Countries involved in the project. These projects
typically focus on three different types of activities:
* curriculum development; 
* modernisation of governance, management and functioning of HEIs;
* strengthening of relations between HEIs and the wider economic and social
  environment."

In our special situation – developing a teaching practice in modern
contradiction oriented innovation methodology (as TRIZ) for a wide ranging
audience reaching from students enroled in engineering courses to those in
computer science or business administration in strong cooperation with
practices of SME business partners – the third line is best suited for this
needs.

We designed a **raw draft** of a possible proposal:
* Evaluate the needs of the SME business partners in the special profile of
  graduates in modern contradiction oriented innovation methodology.
* Collect existing material and experience in that area at the different
  sites, both within the academia but also within the internal training
  processes of the SME partners.
* Set up a joined curriculum and roll out it gradually within the HEI
  partners.  Develop teaching material for these courses and make it available
  as Open Educational Resources.
* Set up laboratory capacity “TRIZ Labs” both conceptually and materially at
  dedicated partners.

The **big story** could be based on the challenges that arise for Europe from
the developments in the Asian region especially in this area (the
mass-engineer-oriented training model MEOTM program (6) in China, MATRIZ has
massive membership growth from this region, so there majorities are yet
changing), but so far are only halfheartedly encountered by the European
research strategies.

The **main project directions** should cover to my understanding the
structures 
* of intra-company training,
* of training and consulting in more complex inter-company business
  structures, 
* the academic anchoring of appropriate training structures of further
  education and 
* the academic anchoring of this topic in the core engineering education.

To a lesser extent, I see a need for common curricular efforts, since many
things already exist. In the proposal we should in my understanding above all
focus on the visibility and networking of such offers, so on the one hand
address the meta-level of the description and common digital exposition of
existing offers and on the other hand on the practical exchange of students
and graduates.

However, these two points should have to be evaluated in more detail against
the call for tenders and, if necessary, the definition of project directions
should be re-evaluated.

A strong link should be made to OER (**Open Educational Resources**), i.e.
compile a stock of freely available (or cooperatively maintained) common
material that can serve local business (both in education and training). So
earn money not from IP but from Services.  Note that we started with this
[WUMM Project](About.html) already an initiative in that direction and set up
a certain github based infrastructure.

One has to fit the proposal along the "political lines" pretended by the EU
"that benefit principally and directly the organisations from eligible Partner
Countries" (i.e. from Region 2 and 4), even if the *real* situation in our
context is completely different and the Member States "benefit principally and
directly" from our activities.
