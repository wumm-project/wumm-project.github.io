# TRIZ Trainings Network

At the [TRIZ Summit in June 2019 in Minsk](https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-eng/)
we discussed in more detail plans to set up an *European TRIZ
Trainings Network* (TTN) and compile an EU proposal to support these plans.

EU proposals are open to *Programme Countries* and *Associated Countries*.
Interest to join forces within this proposal signaled partners from Programme
Countries, Belarus, Morocco and Russia.  There are strong developments to
include also Belarus into the list of Associated Countries, although the
current state is not clear.  Russia belongs to the "countries with jointly
agreed co-funding mechanism covering most or all thematic areas".

Meanwhile TRIZ groups in the Program Countries, Belarus and Russia expressed
their interest to join forces **on our project** to compile an EU proposal in
the proposed direction.  This Web page contains the current state of
preparation of this project as agreed within the communication on our
[mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn)
(with archive accessible to members).  If you are interested to join the
project, please send a mail to
[Hans-Gert Gräbe](http://bis.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/HansGertGraebe/) as the
main coordinator of the project proposal.

In parallel we are discussing to apply for a EC research project to set up a
[Research Network on Systematic Innovation (ReNSI)](ReNSI "wikilink").

## Main ideas

TRIZ trainings exist or are to be developed in many places within the region
under consideration.

The **main focus** of a TTN should therefore be the coordination and mutual
support for these activities and the wider dissemination of *Contradition
Oriented Systematic Innovation* (COSI) as an efficient methodology for solving
complex problems that refuse simple, linear solutions, i.e. the 20%
"Pareto-heavy" tasks, in particular in the *newly emerging technology areas*.
* „TRIZ works well, but one of the key issues is that TRIZ is not yet well
  known; it seems to be too complex but all the attempts to simplify TRIZ did
  quite a damage to its reputation. TRIZ must not be simplified; instead, it
  must be properly structured, learned, and implemented. Only then the real
  results will come, and they will do it at a large scale. But we must admit
  that TRIZ has reached a turning point: it must be capable of supporting
  innovation in all the new and emerging technologies and methodologies of the
  21st century: AI, big data, design thinking, sustainability, IoT, new
  approaches to education, and so forth“. (Valeri Souchkov in his
  [Report on the TRIZFest 2019](https://matriz.org/trizfest-2019-report))

The **big story** could be based on the challenges that arise for Europe from
the developments in the Asian region especially in this area (the
mass-engineer-oriented training model MEOTM program in China, MATRIZ has
massive membership growth from this region, so even majorities are changing),
but so far are only halfheartedly encountered by the European research
strategies.
* For MEOTM see Runhua Tan. TRIZ，the development and dissemination in
  industries in China.  TRIZCON 2017.
  [pdf](https://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/epapers/e2017Papers/eTan-China-Dissemination/eTan-TRIZCON2017-Paper-171012.pdf)

The **main directions of the project at large** should cover the structures
* of intra-company training,
* of training and consulting in more complex inter-company business
  structures, 
* the academic anchoring of appropriate training structures of further
  education and 
* the academic anchoring of this topic in the core engineering education,
even if not all these directions can be covered in a single EU proposal. 

To a lesser extent, there is a need for common curricular efforts, since many
things already exist. In the proposal we should above all focus on the
visibility and networking of such offers, so on the one hand address the
meta-level of the description and common digital exposition of existing offers
and on the other hand the practical exchange of students and graduates.

A strong link should be made to OER (**Open Educational Resources**), i.e.
compile a stock of freely available (or cooperatively maintained) common
material that can serve local business (both in education and training). So
earn money not from IP but from Services.

  Edisons of the 21st Century" of Igor Belski et al. at the Global RMIT
  University
* Note that we started with this [WUMM Project](About.html) another initiative
  in that direction and set up a certain github based infrastructure.

## Building the Consortium

Regardless of the specific application conditions, which, depending on the
call for tenders, require a concentration on 3..5 key partners in a specific
composition, which then also lead the respective EU proposal, we are
consolidating the already visible network structures and create a pool of
**key partners** and **regional coordinators** as the core of a coordinating
structure in order to react quickly on new tenders.

The **coordinators** should
1. represent the entire regional diversity,
2. take over cooperation with other key partners in their respective region
   and  
3. take responsibility for individual work packages coordination.

The **key partners** support the coordinators in their work. The coordinators
form the project consortium that meets the key decisions based on a previously
public discussion on the project mailing list.

At the present time (12 Nov 2019) I agreed in negotiations with different
persons on the following consortial structure (ML - this person subscribed to
the project mailing list). The regions are listed in the order of the date of
the agreement.

Further interest in cooperation have signaled so far

* Kobus Cilliers (ML, systematic-innovation.com, UK, TRIZ Journal editor)
* Christoph Dobrusskin (Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
* Mika Helaskoski (ML, Finland)

## Funding Opportunities

A first approach, already discussed in Minsk, focused on an application for
the ERASMUS+ Key Action 2 Program "Capacity Building in the field of higher
education" (CBHE).
* [The CBHE programm](https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-plus/actions/key-action-2-cooperation-for-innovation-and-exchange-good-practices_en)

During consultations in October 2019 with the Saxonian office that promotes EU
proposals, however, it turned out that the conditions to apply for this
program in our consortium structure are not met. Instead, we are advised to
focus on one of the **Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions** (MSCA) within the
Horizon 2020 Work Program.
* For MSCA see 
  * [the Horizon 2020 website](https://www.kowi.de/Portaldata/2/Resources/horizon2020/wp/h2020-wp1820-msca.pdf)
  * [the Marie Curie Actions web site](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/research-networks_en)

In particular, the **MSCA-ITN-2020 call on Innovative Training Networks** was
considered to be suitable tender, although the focus of such an application
must be on a joint doctoral program, which only indirectly promotes further
aspects of the development of a TTN (from in-company trainings to integration
in undergraduate academic education). Here it would be worth considering
whether further EU funding programs can be used for these aspects in addition.

MSCA-ITN-2020 offers funding for general **collaborative European Training
Networks** (ETN, 445 Mio. Euro), for **European Industrial Doctorates** (EID,
40 Mio. Euro) or **European Joint Doctorates** (EJD, 45 Mio. Euro).  EJD is
reserved for true academic joint doctorate programs, hence is not appropriate
for us.  ETN is very broad in its direction, hence the success rate was low.
The office claimed that the success rate was higher in MSCA-ITN-EID since
there are more focused requirements (both partners from academia and from
industry are requied in the consortium).

* [Application guide to MSCA-ITN-2020](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/h2020-guide-appl-msca-itn_en.pdf)
* [The call](https://www.kowi.de/Portaldata/2/Resources/horizon2020/wp/h2020-wp1820-msca.pdf)

Hence we plan to concentrate forces to apply for the MSCA-ITN-EID tender and
to set up an European Network of academic doctorates in the area of
Contradiction Oriented Systematic Innovation.

Some more considerations about the constraints:
* European Industial Doctorates (EID) projects consist of at least two
  institutions from different EU Member States and / or Associated States and
  different sectors that jointly supervise PhD students and provide training.
  At least one institution must be non-academic, primarily from industry. In
  addition, the networks can also integrate third-country institutions. The
  fellow's stay with the non-academic participant must be at least 50%. It is
  obligatory to enroll in a doctoral program as well as the joint supervision
  by the partners from the academic and non-academic field. The training will
  follow the "EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training".
* Such a structure is strongly related to the TRIZ level 5 certification
  program since this certification has comparable requirements.  By historical
  reasons the TRIZ graduation was so far mainly outside academia.  This is
  sharply changing in Asia where a tightly coupling of academic and
  non-academic graduation is on the way.  Europe is well advised not to miss
  the connection here.

### From the call

**Scope:** ITN (at large) supports competitively selected joint research
training and/or doctoral programmes, implemented by partnerships of
universities, research institutions, research infrastructures, businesses,
SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe
and beyond.

Each programme should have a clearly identified supervisory board
co-ordinating network-wide training and establishing active and continuous
communication and exchange of best practice among the participating
organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.

The programme should exploit complementary competences of the participating
organisations, and enable sharing of knowledge, networking activities, the
organisation of workshops and conferences.

Training responds to well identified needs in defined research areas, with
appropriate references to inter-and multidisciplinary fields and follows the
EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training.  It should be primarily
focused on scientific and technological knowledge through research on
individual, personalised projects.

In order to increase the employability of the researchers, the research
training should be complemented by the meaningful exposure of each researcher
to the non-academic sector. Secondments of the researcher to other
beneficiaries and partner organisations are encouraged, but should be
relevant, feasible, beneficial for the researchers and in line with the
project objectives. ...

In EID, the joint supervision of the researcher must be ensured by at least
one supervisor from the academic sector and one supervisor from the
non-academic sector. These arrangements will be taken into account during the
evaluation of the proposal.

### Additional Information

There is a list of expected impact at several levels at the end of the call
that should be addressed in the proposal.

There is a [list of
projects](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/sites/mariecurie2/files/itn-2018-list-of-projects_0.pdf)
that were successful within the last (2018) MSCA-ITN call.

The call is open since 12 Sep 2019, the deadline is 14 Jan 2020, so it is very
sportive to compile an application in the remaining time.

### Open Questions

* What is the role of the indusrial partners?
