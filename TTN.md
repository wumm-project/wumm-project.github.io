# TRIZ Trainings Network

At the [TRIZ Summit 2019](https://communities.by/events/triz-summit-2019-eng/)
in Minsk we discussed in more detail plans to set up an *European TRIZ
Trainings Network* and compile an ERASMUS+ proposal to support these plans.
In a discussion within the core group we decided to have web sites and
communication within the core team in English.  

**This is a raw first draft of a proposal, subject to further changes in any
  place and point.**

This Web page contains the current state of preparation of the project as
agreed within the communication on our [mailing
list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn) (with
archive accessible to the members only).

If you are interested to join the project, please send a mail to [Hans-Gert
Gräbe](http://bis.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/HansGertGraebe/) as the main
coordinator of the project.

In parallel we are discussing to apply for a EC project to set up a [Research
Network on Systematic Innovation (ReNSI)](ReNSI "wikilink"). 

## The Overall Structure

### Who initiates the proposal

This is a joint initiative of the universities in Leipzig (Germany) and Minsk
(Belarus) that operate a bilateral ERASMUS cooperation agreement since 2006.

We discussed with the local administrations in Minsk (A. Rytov) and Leipzig
(A. Vorpagel) that the best chances for such a proposal are within the Key
Action 2 (1) Programme "Capacity Building in the field of higher education".
The new call is issued in October 2019. It is the last call within that
programme, since the programs will change due to the upcoming new legislation
period of the EU parliament.

There was a similar call for 2018 (2) that we use as a raw guide to set up the
required consortium and agree upon the principal goals of the proposal.

### About the required structure of the proposal 

Due to the special structure of the potential partners we plan to set up a
multiregional project (3, see 3.5 and 3.6 - this has to be evaluated in more
detail). "Eligible countries" (4) are divided into *Programme Countries*
(i.e. Member States of the European Union and some Accociates) and *Partner
Countries* (neighbouring the EU)
* Region 1 - Western Balkans
* Region 2 - Eastern Partnership Countries
* Region 3 - South-Mediterranean countries
* Region 4 - Russian Federation

We plan to include partners from the Member States and the Regions 2 and 4.
The project will be coordinated by the Leipzig University (Dept. of
Mathematics and Computer Science) and co-coordinated by the Belarussian State
University Minsk.

## Rough Structure of the Proposal

As explained in the 2019 guidelines (5, p. 164) “Joint Projects aim at
producing outcomes that benefit principally and directly the organisations
from eligible Partner Countries involved in the project. These projects
typically focus on three different types of activities:
* curriculum development; 
* modernisation of governance, management and functioning of HEIs;
* strengthening of relations between HEIs and the wider economic and social
  environment."

In our special situation – developing a teaching practice in modern
contradiction oriented innovation methodology (as TRIZ) for a wide ranging
audience reaching from students enroled in engineering courses to those in
computer science or business administration in strong cooperation with
practices of SME business partners – the third line is best suited for this
needs.

We designed a raw draft of a possible proposal:
* Evaluate the needs of the SME business partners in the special profile of
  graduates in modern contradiction oriented innovation methodology.
* Collect existing material and experience in that area at the different
  sites, both within the academia but also within the internal training
  processes of the SME partners.
* Set up a joined curriculum and roll out it gradually within the HEI
  partners.  Develop teaching material for these courses and make it available
  as Open Educational Resources.
* Set up laboratory capacity “TRIZ Labs” both conceptually and materially at
  dedicated partners.

A strong link should be made to OER (Open Educational Resources), i.e. compile
a stock of freely available common material that can serve local business
(both in education and training). So earn money not from IP but from Services.
Note that we started with this [WUMM Project](About.html) already an
initiative in that direction and set up a certain github based infrastructure.

One has to fit the proposal along the "political lines" pretended by the EU
"that benefit principally and directly the organisations from eligible Partner
Countries" (i.e. from Region 2 and 4), even if the *real* situation in our
context is completely different and the Member States "benefit principally and
directly" from our activities. 

Due to the ERASMUS restrictions the proposal should indentify at most 10 main
partners in all involved regions, so we think it would be useful to define the
notions *main partner* and *associated partner*, and assign a main partner to
each associate thus assembling *TRIZ Regions*.

We propose to define a *contact person* in each of the upcoming TRIZ Regions
to coordinate the communication within the setup of our proposal and, if the
application will be successful, take the regional responsibility for the
implementation of the project.
