# TRIZ Social Network &ndash; Questions and Answers

**Q:** What's about privacy?

**A:** The publically visible information that you publish at an open platform
as, e.g., Facebook can be followed and "stalked" in many ways since it is
attached to your name (or even nick name &ndash; using modern exploration
technologies this makes almost no difference).  You cannot avoid that.
Different to (e.g.) Facebook and other commercial platform, that process this
information in a hidden and intransparent way to offers you a "ranking" of
search results, we collect this information in a publicly visible way. We
manage **Person URIs** to identify different identities and to report about
your **scientific** efforts within the TRIZ community as the goal of our TRIZ
Social Network.

You can retrieve all information stored about you in our database using
standard RDF technology. We collect only rudimentary information about you as
recommended in the [FOAF ontology](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) &ndash; name,
affiliation, homepage(s).  We do not collect emails due to spam avoiding
reasons.

If you plan to expose more information about your scientific activities we
strongly advice to create and maintain an [ORCID account](https://orcid.org/).
This URI within another system can be referenced in our People database using
the [rdfs:seeAlso](https://www.w3.org/wiki/UsingSeeAlso) predicate.  We
recommend [ORCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID) as a community project
of a great number of scientific organizations.
