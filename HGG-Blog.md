# HGG's Blog

## June 5, 2020:

On
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/111602085556371/2915610628488822) I
made the suggestion to apply a profound TRIZ analysis to the Corona problem as
a challenge full of contraditions to transform the harmful into useful (or -
at least - less harmful). I started a [separate TSN Thread](Corona "wikilink")
to record the most useful proposals.

## May 12, 2020:

May be it is also worth to collect links about
[TRIZ in Business](TIB "wikilink")?
I just started such a collection beginning with Facebook posts.

## May 9, 2020:

Valeri Souchkov about TRIZ and Money. Почему ТРИЗ-команды не запускают свои
продукты? (Why TRIZ teams don't sell their products?)
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBS7SJ7Ht_I>
- <https://www.facebook.com/valeri.souchkov/posts/10214230952722861>

Sergey Simakov started another discussion about the basics of TRIZ.
- Я достаточно часто наезжаю на ТРИЗников и ТРИЗ. НО не всегда и не на всех. И
  что то захотелось обобщить. (I meet TRIZniks and TRIZ quite often. But not always and not all. And I want something generalize.)
- <https://www.facebook.com/sergey.simakov.96/posts/3453248281362566>


There is a continuation of the discussion on the problem "What's the Relation
of Man to its Technical Systems?".  I had a close look into the "MATRIZ
approved material" about TESE, the ["Trends of Engineering Systems
Evolution"](https://www.triz-consulting.de/shop/triz-fachliteratur-buecher/trends-of-engineering-system-evolution/)
and also Nikolay Shpakovsky's Book ["Tree of Technological
Evolution"](https://www.amazon.com/Tree-Technology-Evolution-Nikolay-Shpakovsky/dp/1539892182). 
More is available in a [separate TSN Thread](2019-12-07 "wikilink").

## April 8, 2020:

Anatoly Agulyansky shared in the
[TRIZ Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/111602085556371)
the following link to <https://www.priz.guru> about
[Fundamental and Auxiliary Root Causes](https://www.priz.guru/a-root-cause-analysis-using-priz-innovation-platform)
published on September 26, 2019.

On the TRIZ Facebook channel a reminder to a [2003 paper on application of
TRIZ principles within the SARS
epidemy](https://triz-journal.com/sars-40-principles-eliminating-technical-contradictions-creative-singapore/)
published in the TRIZ Journal was posted showing that using TRIZ principles is
widespread, even if unconscious.

## March 9, 2020:

Valeri Souchkov about the role of ideas for solutions in complex challenges in
a post on his Facebook channel.

Kozhemyako: interview about TRIZ [myths, opportunities, trends])

## December 21, 2019:

The relationship between TRIZ and philosophical questions, in particular those
related to Hegel's dialectic and thus also to the fundamental epistemic
assumptions of Marx and Engels, is undisputed, see for example the work of
[Justus Schollmeyer](https://leibniz-institut.de/en/justus-schollmeyer/). In
his [work](https://matriz.org/kozhemyako/), Anton Kozhemyako refers strongly
to philosophical theory buildings, which were designed within the school of
the Russian philosopher G.P. Schtschedrovitsky. Mikhail Rubin criticized this
reference in his [expert opinion](https://matriz.org/kozhemyako/) of
Kozhemyako's work as unsustainable mainly due to terminology inconsistencies.
That remains to be explored.

* [Георгий Петрович Щедровицкий](https://www.fondgp.ru/)
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Shchedrovitsky>
  * He became involved in the Moscow Methodological Circle set up by Alexander
    Zinoviev. In 1954, Shchedrovitsky took over leadership of the circle and
    played a prominent role in developing activity theory. Here the world was
    not seen as composed of human subjects and objects as in naturalistic
    theory.  Rather objects are secondary constructs whose nature depends on
    the activity applied to them.
  * The MMC has had a lasting impact on Russian systems thinking particularly
    through the Methodological School of Management

    * "The organization of thought and practice changes from a scientific form
      of organization to a methodological form of organization. Just as the
      scientific form was strongly dominant in the last 300 years, the
      methodological form will be strongly dominant in the future."      
    * "Today we have to divide the world into the world of thinking and the
      naturalistic world, whereby the world of thinking is primary and the
      naturalistic world is nothing but a construction of the naturalists."

## December 7, 2019:

I started a discussion about the problem "What's the Relation of Man to its
Technical Systems?". The starting point came from the Development Laws of
Technical Systems that play an important role in TRIZ theory, but are shaped
in a different manner within different TRIZ schools.  

The discussion was started in the [TRIZ facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/111602085556371) a consolidated version
of the discussion both in German and Russian is available in a [separate TSN
Thread](2019-12-07 "wikilink").  Meanwhile additional remarks and links were
added.

## November 10, 2019:

There was a discussion about TRIZ and the notions of component, system and
function on [Sergey Simakov's](https://www.facebook.com/sergey.simakov.96)
Facebook channel.  Some of the material is recorded and planned to be
translated in English in a [separate TSN Thread](2019-11-10 "wikilink").

## October 23, 2019:

Natalya Rubina published the material for the TRIZ Cup 2020.

A version with English and German Translation is on the way and will be
available in the directory TRIZCup/2020 of the
[OpenDiscovery](https://github.com/wumm-project/OpenDiscovery) WUMM
subproject.
* Meanwhile (Nov 8, 2019) I finished the translation of the exercises to
  German. I have no idea if this requires an authorization by the
  org. committee, so be aware that this is an (yet) unauthorized translation.
* During the translation process I collected more experience about the
  problems of multilingual projects, see my
  [report](https://github.com/wumm-project/OpenDiscovery/blob/master/TRIZ-Cup/2020/README.md).
