# Different WUMM Tools

We operate a [prototypical web site](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de).
* This is an experimental demonstation site based on the Bootstrap Framework
  and the EasyRdf PHP Library. It is running on a server at Leipzig
  University.
* The code is available from our github [web
  repo](https://github.com/wumm-project/web).

We operate a Virtuoso based RDF store and a [SPARQL
Endpoint](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de:8891/sparql).  This is also running on a
server at Leipzig University.
* How to set up your own local [SPARQL Endpoint](LocalSparqlEndpoint
