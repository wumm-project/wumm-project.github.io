## Letter to the TRIZ Masters (September 8, 2019)

Translation of <https://triz-summit.ru/certif/master/let/>

Dear Colleagues!

I am appealing to you on behalf of the initiative group on foundation and
development of the International Council of TRIZ Masters. All of us and every
one of us separately have done a lot for the development of TRIZ movement. For
all of us, TRIZ is an important part of our lives and we would like to
preserve it for younger generations as our teachers did. We decided to create
an "International Council of TRIZ Masters" to enhance the professional level
and development of TRIZ, to eliminate the monopoly on our common cause.

### 1. Prerequisites for establishing the "International Council of TRIZ Masters"

Central for developing TRIZ is the institute of TRIZ Masters Diploma awarding.
This procedure went through three (even 4) stages:

- the first list of TRIZ Masters (1998) was prepared by G.S. Altshuller on
  behalf of the All-Russian TRIZ Association and then on behalf of
  the International TRIZ Association.
- At the second stage, in 2006, the system of TRIZ Master diploma awarding on
  behalf of the International Public Association of professional teachers,
  developers and users of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (Moscow,
  Russian Federation) was developed. Approximately in 2008 this organisation
  was liquidated as a legal entity due to non-submission of reports by the
  head of its board (M. Barkan).
- At the third stage, the TRIZ Master diploma awarding mechanism was connected
  to another organization created by M. Barkan "The International TRIZ
  Association Inc. (USA)".

As an illustration of these processes, we present an extract from the registry
of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, where our organization
(MA TRIZ) was excluded, as well as copies of seals used at the 2nd and 3rd
stages (see the original web site).

The inscription "International Public Association of Professional Teachers,
Developers and Users of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ),
Registration Certificate of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation
No. 3784" disappeared from the membership cards of the American MA TRIZ and
another organiaational seal (USA) is used. This is not the organisation that
G.S. Altshuller created.

The official legal and financial documents of "The International TRIZ
Association Inc. (USA)" are not disclosed. There is an assumption that it is a
commercial organisation (Incorporated is analogous to Limited).

In any case, a situation arose, when the mechanism of TRIZ specialist
certification operating under this organisation turned out to be inefficient,
closed for development and closed from TRIZ Masters, who were supposed to
perform functions of the Supervisory Board for this organisation.

From all of this it can be concluded that central to the certification
mechanisms is the professional community of TRIZ Masters, while the
organisations that provide them an opportunity to form their own decision can
be different. This is the origin of the idea to create an organisation of TRIZ
Masters: the International Public Association of TRIZ Masters "International
Council of TRIZ Masters".

### 2. General Principles of Formation of the "International Council of TRIZ Masters".

We do not wish to limit anybody's possibilities, but to give choices and to
expand the rights to develop the TRIZ certification system and to obtain TRIZ
Master qualification. This idea is implemented in partnership with the TRIZ
Developers' Summit and all other TRIZ organisations that are willing to
cooperate with us.

The Initiative Group prepared [Bylaws of our Association](TMC-Bylaws),
"Regulations on awarding TRIZ Specialist the Highest Professional
Qualification (TRIZ Master)", and draft minutes of the Founding Meeting of the
International Council of TRIZ Masters. Please review these documents and write
to us if you have any suggestions on their content.

### 3. Next steps.

A big request to send me your decisions:
- a) Readiness to be among the founders of this Association "International
  Council of TRIZ Masters".
- b) To become a member of the qualification committee for TRIZ Master which
  reviews TRIZ Master applications for achievements in practical application
  of TRIZ (we already have at least one application).

Together with M.S. Gafitulin, we will prepare a form and a logo for the
Association. The certification will be developed based on the "Icarus and
Daedalus" system. We should pay special attention to the training of young
personnel worthy of obtaining the title of TRIZ Master.

We are waiting for your decisions.

Good luck!

Mikhail Rubin, September 8, 2019.
