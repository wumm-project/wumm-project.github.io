title: The WUMM Project
---

This is a first small hack of a web site for the WUMM Project that aims at
collecting different information about contradition oriented innovation
methods, in particular the [TRIZ
methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ), in RDF format for the public
as [Linked Open Data](http://lod-cloud.net/).

The Project operates a [github organizational
account](https://github.com/wumm-project).

One of the main goals of the project is to clarify the licensing situation of
texts, presentations an pictures in use within the community. All material
should be explicitely made available under the terms of appropriate [Creative
Commons CC Licenses](http://creativecommons.org).

See the [About Section](About "wikilink") for detailed information about the
goals and motivation of our project.
