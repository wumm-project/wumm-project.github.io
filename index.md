title: The WUMM Project
---

We use these Github Pages as the web site of the WUMM Project that aims at
collecting different information about contradition oriented innovation
methods, in particular the
[TRIZ methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ), in RDF format for the
public as [Linked Open Data](http://lod-cloud.net/).

WUMM abbreviates the German phrase "Widerspr√ºche und Management-Methoden"
(Contradictions and Management Methods) and is in use as an open branding
since 2019.

The Project operates a
[github organizational account](https://github.com/wumm-project).

One of the goals of the project is to clarify the licensing situation of
texts, presentations and pictures in use within the community. All material
should be explicitely made available under the terms of appropriate [Creative
Commons CC Licenses](http://creativecommons.org).

See the [About Section](About) for detailed information about the goals and
motivation of our project.
