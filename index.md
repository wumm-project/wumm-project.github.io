title: The WUMM Project
---

This is a first small hack of a web site for the WUMM Project that aims at
collecting different information about contradition oriented innovation
methods, in particular the [TRIZ
methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ), in RDF format for the public
as [Linked Open Data](http://lod-cloud.net/).

The Project operates a [github organizational
account](https://github.com/wumm-project).

One of the main goals of the project is the clarification of the licensing
situation of texts, presentations an pictures in use within the community. All
material should be explicitely made available under the terms of approrpiate
[Creative Commons CC Licenses](http://creativecommons.org).
