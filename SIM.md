# Towards a proposal for an ERASMUS+ Knowledge Alliance "Systematic Innovation Methodologies" (SIM)

## Background

Evaluating different opportunities the ERASMUS+ Key Action 2 Programme
"Knowledge Alliances" seems best to fit the current state to link existing and
planned curricula in "Systematic Innovation Methodologies" at different HEI
(higher educational institutions) with the requirements and needs of industry.

The focus of the action is on cooperation between Programme Countries (the
strongest expressed interest in an application came so far from the EU
countries Germany, France and Finland) but organisations from Partner
Countries can also be involved, if the added value is appropriately expressed.
* "As a general rule, Knowledge Alliances target the cooperation between
  organisations established in Programme Countries. However, organisations
  from Partner Countries can be involved in a Knowledge Alliance, as partners
  (not as applicants), if their participation brings an essential added value
  to the project". (All citations from the Programme Guide)

Trainings in "Systematic Innovation Methodologies" address "cross cutting"
methodological skills that are useful for engineers, computer scientists and
other professionals, hence fit "developing entrepreneurship mind-set and
skills" (Programme Guide) and should be included as "general studies" in the
course of studies in different specialities.  The content of such programs
should be developed and coordinated in close coordination with the needs of
industry application partners.
* "Knowledge Alliances implement a coherent and comprehensive set of
  interconnected activities which are flexible and adaptable to different
  current and future contexts and developments across Europe".
* "Knowledge Alliances are transnational and involve minimum six independent
  organisations from at least three Programme Countries, out of which at least
  two higher education institutions and at least two enterprises".

There is a first project outline available in the archive of the mailing list,
which has to be discussed in more detail during the next weeks. It was not yet
coordinated with other parties in detail. Comparable projects have 10-12
partners, for the moment I limited myself to presenting the minimum number
required concerning the country structure as well as the application logic.
This does not mean that other partners cannot be involved. Already listed
partners who see themselves out of place or do not fulfill the conditions
required by the tender (in particular that a HEI full partner must have a
valid ERASMUS Charter ECHE, see p. 320 in the Program Guide) can be replaced
by other interested parties.

## From the call

* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 2-year Knowledge Alliance: 700 000 EUR
* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 3-year Knowledge Alliance: 1 000 000 EUR
* Financial contributions from the EU are calculated using fixed scale of unit
  costs.  Please see Programme Guide, page 130-133 for further information.
* These unit costs have been calculated in a way that the co-funding is
  inherent to them, i.e. already incorporated.

### Aims and Priorities

Knowledge Alliances aim at strengthening Europe's innovation capacity and at
fostering innovation in higher education, business and the broader
socio-economic environment. They intend to achieve one or more of the
following aims:
* develop new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and
  learning; 
* stimulate entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills of higher education
  teaching staff and company staff; 
* facilitate the exchange, flow and co-creation of knowledge.

The main attention is turned to projects that contribute to the modernisation
of Europe's higher education systems as outlined in the 2017 EU Communication
on the Renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education, namely:
* tackling future skills mismatches and promoting excellence in skills
  development; 
* building inclusive and connected higher education systems;
* ensuring higher education institutions contribute to innovation;
* supporting effective and efficient higher education systems.

Additional emphasis is placed on making use of existing initiatives, and on
the intelligent use of digital tools as recommended in the 2013 EU
Communication on Opening Up Education.

The Programme Guide contains a list of key features
* __Innovation__ in higher education and innovation through higher education
  in enterprises; 
* __Sustainability__ of university-business cooperation. A strong and
  committed partnership with a balanced participation from enterprises and
  higher education institutions;
* __Impact__ going beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations
  involved in the Alliance; 

which must convincingly present in a successful application. 

The Guide emphasizes that "Knowledge Alliances are a highly competitive part of
Erasmus+". Common attributes of successful proposals are:
* reliable relations between higher education institutions and enterprises:
  Knowledge Alliances have to demonstrate the commitment and added value of
  all partners, whereby strong and balanced involvement from both the business
  and higher education sectors is essential. A well designed proposal is the
  result of close cooperation between the prospective partners and based on a
  solid needs analysis;
* their innovative and transnational character, visible across all criteria.

A proper needs-analysis clarifies the rationale, influences the selection of
partners, makes the proposal specific, helps to raise the potential for impact
and ensures that end-user and target groups are well involved in the project
activities.

### Award Criteria

* Relevance of the proposal (Purpose, Consistency, Innovation, European added
  value) - 25 points
* Quality of the project design and implementation (Coherence, Structure,
  Management, Quality) - 25 points
* Quality of the project team and the cooperation arrangements (Configuration,
  Commitment, Partnership, Collaboration/team spirit, Reward, Involvement of
  Partner Countries) - 30 points
* Impact and dissemination (Exploitation, Dissemination, Impact, Open Access,
  Sustainability) - 20 points

### Important cross-sectional tasks

* __Quality assurance__ must be an embedded project component to ensure that
  Knowledge Alliances successfully deliver the expected results and achieve an
  impact going far beyond the partner organisations themselves.
* Knowledge Alliances are required to accomplish
  __targeted dissemination activities__ which reach out to stakeholders, policy
  makers, professionals and enterprises.
* Along the way Knowledge Alliances should __deliver publications__ such as
  reports, handbooks, guidelines, etc. As a general rule, results should be
  made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant
  professional, sectorial or competent authorities' platforms.
* Knowledge Alliances should generate new ways and instruments to facilitate
  their collaboration and to ensure that the partnership between higher
  education and business __persists__.
* Knowledge Alliances are a recent and ambitious Action; they are subject to a
  particular __monitoring__ which requires active participation from all
  participants and stakeholders.
* Knowledge Alliances should foresee their
  __participation in thematic clusters__
  to support cross-fertilisation, exchange of good practices and mutual
  learning.
* Additionally, Knowledge Alliances should budget for the presentation of
  their project and the results at the __University-Business Forum__ and/or
  other relevant events (up to five during the project duration).

### Ideas on Substantive Sharpening of the Application Content

In the Programme Guide a special example "Developing entrepreneurial mind-set
and skills" is described with the following content:
* creating schemes of transversal skills learning and application throughout
  higher education programmes developed in cooperation with enterprises aiming
  at strengthening employability, creativity and new professional paths;
* introducing entrepreneurship education in any discipline to provide
  students, researchers, staff and educators with the knowledge, skills and
  motivation to engage in entrepreneurial activities in a variety of settings;
* opening up new learning opportunities through the practical application of
  entrepreneurial skills, which can involve and/or lead to the
  commercialisation of new services, products and prototypes, to the creation
  of start-ups and spin-offs.

This could serve as guideline to compile our application as a curricular
development and coordination activity in a wide sense taking the aims and
priorities as guardrails and the cross-sectional tasks as beacons. 

### Organisational Aspects

The call is open since 14 Nov 2019, the deadline is 26 Febr 2020, so it is
very sportive to compile an application in the remaining time.

We have to identify 

* The __Applicant/coordinator__: a participating organisation that submits the
  project proposal on behalf of all the partners. The coordinator has the full
  responsibility to ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with
  the agreement.
  * I discussed earlier with our local authorities that the Leipzig University
    can serve as coordinator.
* __Full partners__ are those participating organisations which contribute
  actively to the achievement of the Knowledge Alliance's objectives. Each
  full partner must sign a mandate to confer to the coordinating organisation
  the responsibility of acting as main beneficiary and act in his name during
  the implementation of the project. If relevant, the same applies for
  partners from Partner Countries.
* __Associated partners__ (optional): Knowledge Alliances can involve
  associated partners who contribute to the implementation of specific project
  tasks/activities or support the dissemination and sustainability of the
  Alliance. For contractual management issues, ‚Äúassociated partners‚Äù are not
  considered as part of the project partners, and they do not receive funding.
  However their involvement and role in the project and different activities
  have to be clearly described.
  - Contribute indirectly to the project (for example, advice, dissemination,
    internships) 
* __Affiliated entities__ (optional): Organisations which contribute to the
  achievement of project objectives and activities.  Affiliated entities must
  be identified in the grant application and satisfy the requirements as
  described in Annex III (Glossary of terms) of this Programme Guide.

All relevant problems are best to be discussed on our
[mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn).

A first draft of a Project Outline was attached to a mail on the mailing
list on 12 December 2019.

There will be an onsite meeting at INSA Strasbourg (Denis Cavallucci) on
16./17. December 2019.

### Eligible Costs (see p. 138-141 in the Programme Guide)

* __Project implementation__ - project management, project meetings,
  intellectual outputs (e.g. curricula, IT tools, studies), dissemination,
  conference attendance etc.
  - Determination of the EU grant based on number of days times profile of the 
    personnel from the individual countries (unit costs)
  - Does usually not cover all costs
* (optional): Additionally for __learning mobility activities__ (e.g. exchange
  of students, scientists, university and company staff) to support the
  project. 
  - Travel costs (unit costs) and subsistence costs (unit costs)

### Hints for a sound application

Content:
* __Solid needs analysis:__ detailed and convincing explanations,
  participation of all partners.
* Clearly emphasize __benefits for all partners__ - starting already from the
  application phase.
* Focus on __innovation__.
* __Quality of the project team__ and cooperation agreements: Show the
  complementarity of partners, clear division of tasks, effective mechanisms
  for coordination and communication. 
* __Consortium - companies__: companies are actively involved and show solid
  results, commitment and intention of a long-lasting partnership with the
  HEI.
* __Impact and Sustainability__: explain the short and long-term impact of the
  project plan, plan a sustainability strategy from the very beginning.

Form:
* Coherent (problems, solutions, target groups, activities, budget,
  ambitions/resources/competence)
* Simple (objectives, approach)
* Evidence based (ex-ante needs analysis, state of art)
* Clear (identifying the need for such a proposal, solutions, and outputs)
* Rigorous in its planning (which activities, when, for how long, and with
  what resources)
* Explicit (do not take for granted any information, if it is not in the
  application it cannot be taken into account)
* Circumscribed (a proposal is not about solving the world‚Äôs problems, but
  about solving a specific issue)
