  * Please supply your partner letter to Hans-Gert Gräbe, UL until Jan 31,
    2020.  A signed and scanned version is sufficient.
* [Detailed Project Description](Erasmus/detailed_project_description.pdf), to
  be delivered as annex of the proposal
  * The current state (26.01.2020)
  * Part 0. - due 17.02.2020
  * Part 1,2,4,5. "General Nonsense" - due 03.02.2020
  * Part 3. "Partner Descriptions" - due 03.02.2020
  * Part 7. "Work Packages - content" - due 10.02.2020
  * Part 7. "Work Packages - time and cost schedule" - due 17.02.2020
  * Part 8. "Associated Partners" - due 10.02.2020
* Prepare the Detailed Budget Plan
  * Based on Part 7 final - due 17.02.2020
* Prepare the eForm
  * First preparation - due 03.02.2020
  * Final preparation - due 17.02.2020

Full partners are required
* to have a __PIC__ within the EU Database
  * PIC is a 9-digit code required for an organisation to participate in a EU
    funded project. [More](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/applying-for-funding/register-an-organisation/registration-of-organisation_en.htm)
* are requested to take the lead of Work Packages.
* HEI full partners must have additionally a valid __ERASMUS Charter ECHE__
  (Program Guide, p. 320). This was positively checked for all HEI partners.

If the proposal will be selected moreover a __mandate letter__ from each full
partner to the applicant is required in due time. Being successful with our
application we have only 4 weeks to collect all documents and sign the
agreement. 
* "Mandate letters signed by the partners are a contractual requirement and
  will therefore be requested after the selection of proposals, prior to the
  signature of the relevant grant agreements with the selected projects".
* The correct template has yet to be identified. 

The __Declaration of Honour__ has finally to be signed by the authorities of
the applicant, i.e., the rector's office of Leipzig University.  Required
documents to sign this declaration are
* the application, including the budget plan
* funding notification from the Dean of the Faculty (in preparation)
* partner letters of the full partners.

Here is the external link to the documents to be uploaded in the Participant
Register of the Funding & Tender Opportunities Portal:

## What do we expect from an industrial partner

Ideally, the contribution should be sharpened in the project itself in a WP
that it can be processed. The six points below in the "hints for a sound
application", i.e.

* Solid needs analysis: detailed and convincing explanations, participation of
  all partners. 
* Clearly emphasize benefits for all partners - starting already from the
  application phase.
* Focus on innovation.
* Quality of the project team and cooperation agreements: Show the
  complementarity of partners, clear division of tasks, effective mechanisms
  for coordination and communication.
* Consortium - companies: companies are actively involved and show solid
  results, commitment and intention of a long-lasting partnership with the
  HEI.
* Impact and Sustainability: explain the short and long-term impact of the
  project plan, plan a sustainability strategy from the very beginning.

This describes where to go: "companies are actively involved and show solid
results, commitment and intention of a long-lasting partnership with the HEI".
That would have to be filled with life, whereby here, of course, the question
is what companies expect from HEI (higher educational institutions). We
intentionally include a broader HEI spectrum, from universities, technical
universities and universities of applied sciences to dual vocational training
(Jantschgi in Graz), and also HEI with different experience in teaching
already such methodologies.

Possible added value for the industrial company is influence and early access
to developed teaching content and premium access to graduates that are yet
skilled in the methodologies.  Conversely, use cases and internships would of
course also be interesting.

So the idea is that they
* contribute in shaping the curricula
* provide useful use cases
* provide also practices and support in graduation in their company. 

Benefits are:
* Premium access to graduates skilled in that area
* Leading position in an ongoing process of shaping soft skills in HR
  important for the future of companies at large (Samsung understood this
  already 20 years ago)

Time expenditures:
* no idea yet, but scalable (a WP schedule has yet to be compiled)
* Schaeffler's contribution: 3.5 PM

Costs:
* eligible costs from the project budget (see below) do not cover the whole
  business, so also here: no idea yet, but scalable.

## Background

Evaluating different opportunities the ERASMUS+ Key Action 2 Programme
"Knowledge Alliances" seems best to fit the current state to link existing and
planned curricula in "Systematic Innovation Methodologies" at different HEI
(higher educational institutions) with the requirements and needs of industry.

The focus of the action is on cooperation between Programme Countries but
organisations from Partner Countries can also be involved, if the added value
is appropriately expressed. (Programme Guide, p. 133)

Full Partners:
* Leipzig University (applicant, coordination), Germany - Gräbe, Neumuth - HEI
* INSA Strasbourg, France - Cavallucci - HEI
* HS Offenburg, Germany - Livotov - HEI
* BUT Brno, Czech Republic - Busov - HEI
* UTC Cluj-Napoca, Romania - Brad - HEI
* LUT Lappeenranta, Finland - Chechurin - HEI
* HTL Wolfsberg, Austria - Jantschgi - ORG (vocational education with strong
  relation to SIM) 
* Schaeffler AG, Germany - Lau, Fuhrmann - Industry
* Arxia SRL, Romania - Homorodean - SME 
* Tehnoprod Plast SRL, Romania - Moraru - SME 
* Target Innovation Minsk, Belarus - Shpakovski - SME from Partner Country
* NPK Consult Moscow, Russia - Redkolis - SME from Partner Country
* BM TRIZ Chelyabinsk, Russia - Kozhemyako, Pokalo - SME from Partner Country

Trainings in "Systematic Innovation Methodologies" address "cross cutting"
methodological skills that are useful for engineers, computer scientists and
other professionals, hence fit "developing entrepreneurship mind-set and
skills" (Programme Guide, p. 106) and should be included as "general studies"
in the curricula of different specialities.  The content of such programs
should be developed and coordinated in close coordination with the needs of
industry application partners.

* "Knowledge Alliances implement a coherent and comprehensive set of
  interconnected activities which are flexible and adaptable to different
  current and future contexts and developments across Europe".
* "Knowledge Alliances are transnational and involve minimum six independent
  organisations from at least three Programme Countries, out of which at least
  two higher education institutions and at least two enterprises".

## From the call

* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 2-year Knowledge Alliance: 700000 EUR
* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 3-year Knowledge Alliance: 1000000 EUR
* Financial contributions from the EU are calculated using fixed scale of unit
  costs.  Please see the Programme Guide, page 130-133 for further information.
* These unit costs have been calculated in a way that co-funding is inherent
  to them, i.e. already incorporated.

### Aims and Priorities

Knowledge Alliances aim at strengthening Europe's innovation capacity and at
fostering innovation in higher education, business and the broader
socio-economic environment. They intend to achieve one or more of the
following aims:
* develop new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and
  learning; 
* stimulate entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills of higher education
  teaching staff and company staff; 
* facilitate the exchange, flow and co-creation of knowledge.

The main attention is turned to projects that contribute to the modernisation
of Europe's higher education systems as outlined in the 2017 EU Communication
on the Renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education, namely:
* tackling future skills mismatches and promoting excellence in skills
  development; 
* building inclusive and connected higher education systems;
* ensuring higher education institutions contribute to innovation;
* supporting effective and efficient higher education systems.

Additional emphasis is placed on making use of existing initiatives, and on
the intelligent use of digital tools as recommended in the 2013 EU
Communication on Opening Up Education.

The Programme Guide contains a list of key features
* __Innovation__ in higher education and innovation through higher education
  in enterprises; 
* __Sustainability__ of university-business cooperation. A strong and
  committed partnership with a balanced participation from enterprises and
  higher education institutions;
* __Impact__ going beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations
  involved in the Alliance; 

which must convincingly present in a successful application. 

The Guide emphasizes that "Knowledge Alliances are a highly competitive part of
Erasmus+". Common attributes of successful proposals are:
* reliable relations between higher education institutions and enterprises:
  Knowledge Alliances have to demonstrate the commitment and added value of
  all partners, whereby strong and balanced involvement from both the business
  and higher education sectors is essential. A well designed proposal is the
  result of close cooperation between the prospective partners and based on a
  solid needs analysis;
* their innovative and transnational character, visible across all criteria.

A proper needs-analysis clarifies the rationale, influences the selection of
partners, makes the proposal specific, helps to raise the potential for impact
and ensures that end-user and target groups are well involved in the project
activities.

### Award Criteria

* Relevance of the proposal (Purpose, Consistency, Innovation, European added
  value) - 25 points
* Quality of the project design and implementation (Coherence, Structure,
  Management, Quality) - 25 points
* Quality of the project team and the cooperation arrangements (Configuration,
  Commitment, Partnership, Collaboration/team spirit, Reward, Involvement of
  Partner Countries) - 30 points
* Impact and dissemination (Exploitation, Dissemination, Impact, Open Access,
  Sustainability) - 20 points

### Important cross-sectional tasks

* __Quality assurance__ must be an embedded project component to ensure that
  Knowledge Alliances successfully deliver the expected results and achieve an
  impact going far beyond the partner organisations themselves.
* Knowledge Alliances are required to accomplish
  __targeted dissemination activities__ which reach out to stakeholders, policy
  makers, professionals and enterprises.
* Along the way Knowledge Alliances should __deliver publications__ such as
  reports, handbooks, guidelines, etc. As a general rule, results should be
  made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant
  professional, sectorial or competent authorities' platforms.
* Knowledge Alliances should generate new ways and instruments to facilitate
  their collaboration and to ensure that the partnership between higher
  education and business __persists__.
* Knowledge Alliances are a recent and ambitious Action; they are subject to a
  particular __monitoring__ which requires active participation from all
  participants and stakeholders.
* Knowledge Alliances should foresee their
  __participation in thematic clusters__
  to support cross-fertilisation, exchange of good practices and mutual
  learning.
* Additionally, Knowledge Alliances should budget for the presentation of
  their project and the results at the __University-Business Forum__ and/or
  other relevant events (up to five during the project duration).

### Ideas on Substantive Sharpening of the Application Content

In the Programme Guide a special example "Developing entrepreneurial mind-set
and skills" is described with the following content:
* creating schemes of transversal skills learning and application throughout
  higher education programmes developed in cooperation with enterprises aiming
  at strengthening employability, creativity and new professional paths;
* introducing entrepreneurship education in any discipline to provide
  students, researchers, staff and educators with the knowledge, skills and
  motivation to engage in entrepreneurial activities in a variety of settings;
* opening up new learning opportunities through the practical application of
  entrepreneurial skills, which can involve and/or lead to the
  commercialisation of new services, products and prototypes, to the creation
  of start-ups and spin-offs.

This could serve as guideline to compile our application as a curricular
development and coordination activity in a wide sense taking the aims and
priorities as guardrails and the cross-sectional tasks as beacons. 

### Organisational Aspects

The call is open since 14 Nov 2019, the deadline is 26 Febr 2020, so it is
very sportive to compile an application in the remaining time.

We identified 

* The __Applicant/coordinator__: a participating organisation that submits the
  project proposal on behalf of all the partners. The coordinator has the full
  responsibility to ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with
  the agreement.
  * The Leipzig University serves as coordinator (main coordination by
    Prof. Thomas Neumuth, support by Prof. Hans-Gert Gräbe). 
* __Full partners__ are those participating organisations which contribute
  actively to the achievement of the Knowledge Alliance's objectives. Each
  full partner must sign a mandate to confer to the coordinating organisation
  the responsibility of acting as main beneficiary and act in his name during
  the implementation of the project. The same applies for partners from
  Partner Countries.  
  * See the above listing.
  * Open problems: PICs for the partners from Partner Countries, at least one
    more industrial partner from the Programme Countries.
* __Associated partners__ (optional): Knowledge Alliances can involve
  associated partners who contribute to the implementation of specific project
  tasks/activities or support the dissemination and sustainability of the
  Alliance. For contractual management issues, “associated partners” are not
  considered as part of the project partners, and they do not receive funding.
  However their involvement and role in the project and different activities
  have to be clearly described.
  * The evaluation WP is planned to hand over to a certain consortium of
    Chambers of Industry and Commerce. 

All relevant problems are best to be discussed on our
[mailing list](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/ttn).

### Eligible Costs (see p. 138-141 in the Programme Guide)

* __Project implementation__ - project management, project meetings,
  intellectual outputs (e.g. curricula, IT tools, studies), dissemination,
  conference attendance etc.
  - Determination of the EU grant based on number of days times profile of the 
    personnel from the individual countries (unit costs)
  - Does usually not cover all costs
* (optional): Additionally for __learning mobility activities__ (e.g. exchange
  of students, scientists, university and company staff) to support the
  project. 
  - Travel costs (unit costs) and subsistence costs (unit costs)
  - It is recommended to use also Key Action 1 programs to support individual
    mobility (Programme Guide, p. 134).  

### Hints for a sound application

Content:
* __Solid needs analysis:__ detailed and convincing explanations,
  participation of all partners.
* Clearly emphasize __benefits for all partners__ - starting already from the
  application phase.
* Focus on __innovation__.
* __Quality of the project team__ and cooperation agreements: Show the
  complementarity of partners, clear division of tasks, effective mechanisms
  for coordination and communication. 
* __Consortium - companies__: companies are actively involved and show solid
  results, commitment and intention of a long-lasting partnership with the
  HEI.
* __Impact and Sustainability__: explain the short and long-term impact of the
  project plan, plan a sustainability strategy from the very beginning.

Form:
* Coherent (problems, solutions, target groups, activities, budget,
  ambitions/resources/competence)
* Simple (objectives, approach)
* Evidence based (ex-ante needs analysis, state of art)
* Clear (identifying the need for such a proposal, solutions, and outputs)
* Rigorous in its planning (which activities, when, for how long, and with
  what resources)
* Explicit (do not take for granted any information, if it is not in the
  application it cannot be taken into account)

### About the Content

__Stelian Brad__ (15.12.20191)
- Please consider that we can find a possibility to create a MOOC on TRIZ - we
  have to valorize e-learning platforms (in our case, we can arrange the
  network to have access to a very new platform for synchronous and
  asynchronous education)
- Please consider the focus on open innovation by seeing the network as
  platform where innovation can be run under poly-centric forms of
  collaboration (this is a clear focus of the EC in the next exercise
  2021-2027)
- Because new standards in innovation management systems are becoming more
  important, the network should also consider the smart integration of TRIZ in
  this context
- It would be maybe an opportunity to expand student mobility not only for
  learning, but also for completing their final degree project as part of
  Erasmus+ exchange. This will offer students to apply TRIZ in a wider and
  consolidated way.

__Bohuslav Busov__ (18.12.2019)

* Associated Partners - We plan to integrate also Chambers of Commerce and
  Industry from different countries:
  - I can activate at minimum following possible Associate partners: Economic
    Chamber (IHK) Brno, JIC Brno (South Moravia Innovative Centrum), HUB
    interconnected with BUT Brno, HUB interconnected with TU Ostrava, also
    TRIZing Czech Association under „roof“ of my BUT Brno, where in TRIZing I
    am „president“, IKI Liberec - partially interconnected with TU Liberec
    (Pavel Jirman)
* I completely recommend Target Innovation and especially my friend (since
  1993) Nikolay Shpakovski as expert. He is very experienced and as consultant
  he is able to solve real different innovative tasks (for example in CR:
  Atomic Machinery Pilsen, in Czech: Jaderné strojírenství Plzeň). By the way
  I translated his book OTSM-TRIZ this year. Except of some new TRIZ
  approaches there is lot of cases from Samsung. Some parts from this „higher
  TRIZ pilotage“ are instructional also for my TRIZ students.
* Second I translated during this year the book „150 creative tasks from our
  environment“ (Anatolij Gin, Irina Andrzheevskaja). It is a unique book about
  „clever“ solutions inside fauna and flora. Book for children in nursery
  schools and first year of primary schools.
* Only shortly and briefly about activites and outcomes of the ERASMUS+
  Knowledge Alliance Project for this moment:
  - Team work on selection of the best topics and subtopics from TRIZ for
    teaching and learning study materials, instructional cases, methodical
    recommendations for teachers and users,…  
  - Acessible materials for teachers, students, individual engineers and
    innovative (ambitous) companies.
  - Coordination of activities and cooperation with people, institutions and
    companies interested in improving motivation and solving potential of man
    through not only systematic approach on the start of innovation process
    but also in the frame of synthetic creative phases where methodical
    support by TRIZ instrumetarium is unusual, inspirative and usual
    surprising even for experienced people.  
  - Popularization workshops prepared and organized by TU, or IHK, or
    consultancy firms - for any interested audience.
* Most Technical Universities from Czech Republic can be engaged as applicants
  of project results (Prague, Pilsen, Liberec, Ostrava, Slovakia: Bratislava,
  Žilina, Kosice) where I have good long time contacts with our dean (ČVUT
  Prague), or vice-deans (TU Ostrava) or with enthusiasts attempting teach
  something from TRIZ. I had many popular lectures in these universities
  during the last years for students and teachers. Many texts, translated
  books, .ppt sequencies - used in TU and in companies - in CR went out from
  my „translation pen“. That is why I do not see problems with implementation
  of planned project outcomes. As an attachment see a Graph showing answers
  mostly of companies engineers what they are thinking after short popular
  (informative) introducionary seminars (2-3 hours) as well as after 2+1 days
  educational activities inside companies. From my point of view these answers
  are also relevant documents about Targed groups and Needs of Analysis.  

* My lectures aroud TRIZ started 1996. Feedback of students (Mgr) is very
  positive. I am going to offer TRIZ courses not only for students of two
  departments (til this time), but also for all students and PhD students on
  FEEC (fakulty of electrical engineering and communication) and also as
  optional course for all students of BUT (other faculties: machinery, civil,
  architecture, informatics, business). Of course it is not easy for students
  to choose such a course if they do not know about the potential of TRIZ for
  their future practice… Serious popularization and well elaborated study
  material is not a trivial task in the proposed project.
  - [Survey](Erasmus/Busov-20191218-Survey.pdf) on more than 2000 TRIZ
    training participants which were interviewed about the benefits of TRIZ.
* Addendum 20.12.2019: Some additional remarks about my standpoints you find
  in a [paper](Erasmus/Busov-2017.pdf) and a
  [presentation](Erasmus/Busov-Slides-2017.pdf) prepared for Australia (end
  2017, J. Belski invited Livotov, Chechurin, Cascini, Dobruskin, Berdonosov,
  Busov).
