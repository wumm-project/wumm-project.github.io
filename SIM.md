## What do we expect from industrial partners

Ideally, the contribution should be sharpened in the project itself in a WP
that it can be processed. The six points below in the "hints for a sound
application", i.e.

* Solid needs analysis: detailed and convincing explanations, participation of
  all partners. 
* Clearly emphasize benefits for all partners - starting already from the
  application phase.
* Focus on innovation.
* Quality of the project team and cooperation agreements: Show the
  complementarity of partners, clear division of tasks, effective mechanisms
  for coordination and communication.
* Consortium - companies: companies are actively involved and show solid
  results, commitment and intention of a long-lasting partnership with the
  HEI.
* Impact and Sustainability: explain the short and long-term impact of the
  project plan, plan a sustainability strategy from the very beginning.

This describes where to go: "companies are actively involved and show solid
results, commitment and intention of a long-lasting partnership with the HEI".
That would have to be filled with life, whereby here, of course, the question
is what companies expect from HEI (higher educational institutions). We
intentionally include a broader HEI spectrum, from universities, technical
universities and universities of applied sciences to dual vocational training
(Jantschgi in Graz), and also HEI with different experience in teaching
already such methodologies.

Possible added value for the industrial company is influence and early access
to developed teaching content and premium access to graduates that are yet
skilled in the methodologies.  Conversely, use cases and internships would of
course also be interesting.

So the idea is that they
* contribute in shaping the curricula
* provide useful use cases
* provide also practices and support in graduation in their company. 

Benefits are:
* Premium access to graduates skilled in that area
* Leading position in an ongoing process of shaping soft skills in HR
  important for the future of companies at large (Samsung understood this
  already 20 years ago)

## Background

Evaluating different opportunities the ERASMUS+ Key Action 2 Programme
"Knowledge Alliances" seems best to fit the current state to link existing and
planned curricula in "Systematic Innovation Methodologies" at different HEI
(higher educational institutions) with the requirements and needs of industry.

The focus of the action is on cooperation between Programme Countries but
organisations from Partner Countries can also be involved, if the added value
is appropriately expressed. (Programme Guide, p. 133)

From the call:
* "Knowledge Alliances implement a coherent and comprehensive set of
  interconnected activities which are flexible and adaptable to different
  current and future contexts and developments across Europe".
* "Knowledge Alliances are transnational and involve minimum six independent
  organisations from at least three Programme Countries, out of which at least
  two higher education institutions and at least two enterprises".

## From the call

* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 2-year Knowledge Alliance: 700000 EUR
* Maximum EU contribution awarded for a 3-year Knowledge Alliance: 1000000 EUR
* Financial contributions from the EU are calculated using fixed scale of unit
  costs.  Please see the Programme Guide, page 130-133 for further information.
* These unit costs have been calculated in a way that co-funding is inherent
  to them, i.e. already incorporated.

### Aims and Priorities

Knowledge Alliances aim at strengthening Europe's innovation capacity and at
fostering innovation in higher education, business and the broader
socio-economic environment. They intend to achieve one or more of the
following aims:
* develop new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and
  learning; 
* stimulate entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills of higher education
  teaching staff and company staff; 
* facilitate the exchange, flow and co-creation of knowledge.

The main attention is turned to projects that contribute to the modernisation
of Europe's higher education systems as outlined in the 2017 EU Communication
on the Renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education, namely:
* tackling future skills mismatches and promoting excellence in skills
  development; 
* building inclusive and connected higher education systems;
* ensuring higher education institutions contribute to innovation;
* supporting effective and efficient higher education systems.

### Award Criteria

* Relevance of the proposal (Purpose, Consistency, Innovation, European added
  value) - 25 points
* Quality of the project design and implementation (Coherence, Structure,
  Management, Quality) - 25 points
* Quality of the project team and the cooperation arrangements (Configuration,
  Commitment, Partnership, Collaboration/team spirit, Reward, Involvement of
  Partner Countries) - 30 points
* Impact and dissemination (Exploitation, Dissemination, Impact, Open Access,
  Sustainability) - 20 points

### Important cross-sectional tasks

* __Quality assurance__ must be an embedded project component to ensure that
  Knowledge Alliances successfully deliver the expected results and achieve an
  impact going far beyond the partner organisations themselves.
* Knowledge Alliances are required to accomplish
  __targeted dissemination activities__ which reach out to stakeholders, policy
  makers, professionals and enterprises.
* Along the way Knowledge Alliances should __deliver publications__ such as
  reports, handbooks, guidelines, etc. As a general rule, results should be
  made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant
  professional, sectorial or competent authorities' platforms.
* Knowledge Alliances should generate new ways and instruments to facilitate
  their collaboration and to ensure that the partnership between higher
  education and business __persists__.
* Knowledge Alliances are a recent and ambitious Action; they are subject to a
  particular __monitoring__ which requires active participation from all
  participants and stakeholders.
* Knowledge Alliances should foresee their
  __participation in thematic clusters__
  to support cross-fertilisation, exchange of good practices and mutual
  learning.
* Additionally, Knowledge Alliances should budget for the presentation of
  their project and the results at the __University-Business Forum__ and/or
  other relevant events (up to five during the project duration).

### About the Content

__Stelian Brad__ (15.12.20191)
- Please consider that we can find a possibility to create a MOOC on TRIZ - we
  have to valorize e-learning platforms (in our case, we can arrange the
  network to have access to a very new platform for synchronous and
  asynchronous education)
- Please consider the focus on open innovation by seeing the network as
  platform where innovation can be run under poly-centric forms of
  collaboration (this is a clear focus of the EC in the next exercise
  2021-2027)
- Because new standards in innovation management systems are becoming more
  important, the network should also consider the smart integration of TRIZ in
  this context
- It would be maybe an opportunity to expand student mobility not only for
  learning, but also for completing their final degree project as part of
  Erasmus+ exchange. This will offer students to apply TRIZ in a wider and
  consolidated way.

__Bohuslav Busov__ (18.12.2019)

* Associated Partners - We plan to integrate also Chambers of Commerce and
  Industry from different countries:
  - I can activate at minimum following possible Associate partners: Economic
    Chamber (IHK) Brno, JIC Brno (South Moravia Innovative Centrum), HUB
    interconnected with BUT Brno, HUB interconnected with TU Ostrava, also
    TRIZing Czech Association under „roof“ of my BUT Brno, where in TRIZing I
    am „president“, IKI Liberec - partially interconnected with TU Liberec
    (Pavel Jirman)
* I completely recommend Target Innovation and especially my friend (since
  1993) Nikolay Shpakovski as expert. He is very experienced and as consultant
  he is able to solve real different innovative tasks (for example in CR:
  Atomic Machinery Pilsen, in Czech: Jaderné strojírenství Plzeň). By the way
  I translated his book OTSM-TRIZ this year. Except of some new TRIZ
  approaches there is lot of cases from Samsung. Some parts from this „higher
  TRIZ pilotage“ are instructional also for my TRIZ students.
* Second I translated during this year the book „150 creative tasks from our
  environment“ (Anatolij Gin, Irina Andrzheevskaja). It is a unique book about
  „clever“ solutions inside fauna and flora. Book for children in nursery
  schools and first year of primary schools.
