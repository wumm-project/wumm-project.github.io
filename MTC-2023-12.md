## Essential points

(1) Self-Identification
* Thomas Kuhn and the “land surveyors”
  * Relativity theory and GLONASS...
* Value of “continued development” in logic, particularly through overcoming crises

(2) Purposes
* My report and probably all the events are drafts for the Work Program
* We say NO! to “blind” application of TRIZ developments to social and economic questions or “Historical Materialism”... 
  * This is neither correct theorically nor backed by practice
* I must admit there is a lack of strong ideas. There are world-class developments in TRIZ for the “Technical” section, including  Technical Contradictions, Physical Contradictions, Altshuller Matrix, Contradiction-Handling Techniques, etc.
  * We need new breakthrough ideas!

(3) Problematic fields
* If we take today’s TRIZ for management: where exactly is it TRIZ? What are its peculiarities? (aside from Altshuller’s stipulations from Article 1?)
* The concept of Technical system... uncritical extrapolation to other objects, including management systems and managing systems as well as organizational technique systems. What is that and what is the difference?
  * We believe that the answer lies in the “technical” relation field, the fact of being fabricated.
  * As Altshuller put it, no technical system is complete by itself. Humans complete them with aiming.
* “Thinking economy”, economy of TRIZ projects. How to assess the economic effect of “thinking” from TRIZ projects (otherwise than through “deployment”?)
* Where do “ideas” come from? TRL 0 and TRL 1
* Workflow organization in scientific research institutes (NII) and construction bureaus (KB), success cases of Samsung and GE, but lacking substantiation for replicating
* Development contradictions: transition from levels 3 and 4 to a new S curve

(4) Why Bodganov and Tectology?
* A hypothetical answer can be obtained upon completion of all the events within the Conference.
* It was a coincidence ... see info on Dec 7
* Intuition. 
* Marxist as well but “opposed to mainstream”
* “Organization” vs “Development regularities” = “Activity” vs “Naturalism” / “Dogmatism”
